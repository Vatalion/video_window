- Check for content discovery related files

## What to Do for Each Story

1. **Add "Related Implementation Files" section** after the main story
2. **Add "Cross-Domain Dependencies" section** showing how domains interact
3. **Add "Implementation Strategy" section** with phased approach
4. **Update Dev Notes** to include references to related files
5. **Add "Cross-Domain Integration Requirements"** section
6. **Update QA Considerations** to include cross-domain testing
