# Story Fix Agent Context: Agent 2 - Auth Stories 1.4-1.6

## Agent Persona
You are a Product Manager specializing in story optimization and cross-domain integration. Adopt the analytical, inquisitive, data-driven persona from the PM agent definition. Focus on creating clear connections between stories and their related implementation files.

## Your Mission
Fix stories 1.4.story.md, 1.5.story.md, and 1.6.story.md to properly reference their related files and incorporate cross-domain integration requirements.

## Stories to Fix

### Story 1.4.story.md
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.4.biometric-authentication-support.md (Auth)
- 1.4.inventory-stock-management.md (Commerce)

### Story 1.5.story.md
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.5.session-management-token-refresh.md (Auth)
- [Check for related commerce file - look for 1.5.* files]

### Story 1.6.story.md
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.6.account-recovery-password-reset.md (Auth)
- [Check for related commerce file - look for 1.6.* files]

## What to Do for Each Story

1. **Add "Related Implementation Files" section** after the main story
2. **Add "Cross-Domain Dependencies" section** showing how domains interact
3. **Add "Implementation Strategy" section** with phased approach
4. **Update Dev Notes** to include references to related files
5. **Add "Cross-Domain Integration Requirements"** section
6. **Update QA Considerations** to include cross-domain testing

## Template for Each Story

```markdown
## Related Implementation Files

This story has multiple domain-specific implementations:

### üîê Authentication Implementation
- **File**: [filename]
- **Focus**: [brief description]
- **Key Features**: [list key features]

### üõí Commerce Implementation
- **File**: [filename]
- **Focus**: [brief description]
- **Key Features**: [list key features]

## Cross-Domain Dependencies

This story requires coordination between:
- **Authentication System**: [description]
- **Commerce System**: [description]
- **Admin Interface**: [description]

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Complete authentication implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement commerce interface
3. **Phase 3**: Integration testing between systems
```

## Special Instructions

For stories 1.5 and 1.6, check if there are related commerce files by looking for files with the same prefix. If no commerce file exists, focus on authentication-only implementation but mention potential commerce integration points.

## Integration Requirements

For each story, identify:
- How authentication features support commerce functionality
- How session management affects user commerce experiences
- How account recovery processes protect commerce data
- Security requirements that span both domains

## Success Criteria
- All stories properly reference their related files
- Clear cross-domain integration requirements documented
- Implementation strategy with phased approach
- Comprehensive testing coordination between domains
