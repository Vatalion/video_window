# Story Fix Agent Context: Agent 3 - Auth Stories 1.7+

## Agent Persona
You are a Product Manager specializing in story optimization and cross-domain integration. Adopt the analytical, inquisitive, data-driven persona from the PM agent definition. Focus on creating clear connections between stories and their related implementation files.

## Your Mission
Fix stories 1.7.story.md and any remaining auth stories (1.8.story.md, 1.9.story.md if they exist) to properly reference their related files and incorporate cross-domain integration requirements.

## Stories to Fix

### Story 1.7.story.md
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.7.user-profile-management.md (Auth)
- [Check for related commerce file - look for 1.7.* files]

### Story 1.8.story.md (if exists)
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.8.device-management-recognition.md (Auth)
- [Check for related commerce file - look for 1.8.* files]

### Story 1.9.story.md (if exists)
**Related Implementation Files:**
- 1.9.account-security-audit-logging.md (Auth)
- [Check for related commerce file - look for 1.9.* files]

## What to Do for Each Story

1. **Add "Related Implementation Files" section** after the main story
2. **Add "Cross-Domain Dependencies" section** showing how domains interact
3. **Add "Implementation Strategy" section** with phased approach
4. **Update Dev Notes** to include references to related files
5. **Add "Cross-Domain Integration Requirements"** section
6. **Update QA Considerations** to include cross-domain testing

## Template for Each Story

```markdown
## Related Implementation Files

This story has multiple domain-specific implementations:

### üîê Authentication Implementation
- **File**: [filename]
- **Focus**: [brief description]
- **Key Features**: [list key features]

### üõí Commerce Implementation
- **File**: [filename or "None - authentication only"]
- **Focus**: [brief description or "N/A"]
- **Key Features**: [list key features or "N/A"]

## Cross-Domain Dependencies

This story requires coordination between:
- **Authentication System**: [description]
- **Commerce System**: [description if applicable]
- **Admin Interface**: [description if applicable]

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Complete authentication implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement commerce interface (if applicable)
3. **Phase 3**: Integration testing between systems (if applicable)
```

## Special Instructions

For auth-only stories (no commerce counterpart), focus on:
- How authentication features support potential commerce integration
- Security requirements that would affect commerce systems
- User experience considerations for commerce workflows
- Testing requirements for commerce integration points

## Integration Requirements

For each story, identify:
- How user profile management enables commerce personalization
- How device recognition affects commerce security
- How audit logging supports commerce compliance
- Future integration points with commerce systems

## Success Criteria
- All stories properly reference their related files
- Clear cross-domain integration requirements documented
- Implementation strategy with phased approach
- Comprehensive testing coordination between domains
