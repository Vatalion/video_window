3. **Add Cross-Domain Integration**: Include references to authentication, commerce, and other systems
4. **Reference Implementation File**: Add "Related Implementation Files" section linking to the implementation file
5. **Include Integration Requirements**: Detail how the story integrates with other domains

## Template for Each Story

```markdown
# Story {number}: [Descriptive Title]

## Status: Draft

## Story
**As a** [role],
**I want** [action],
