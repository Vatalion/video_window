# Create Worktree Plan Task

## Purpose

To generate a comprehensive Git worktree development strategy for parallel story development, including setup commands, coordination workflows, and integration procedures.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution

### 1. Analyze Current Repository State

#### 1.1 Repository Analysis
- Check current Git branch structure
- Identify existing worktrees (if any)
- Assess repository size and clone implications
- Review .gitignore and worktree-specific ignore patterns

#### 1.2 Development Environment Assessment
- Check available disk space for multiple worktrees
- Identify IDE/editor configuration requirements for worktrees
- Assess build tool compatibility with worktrees
- Review CI/CD pipeline worktree considerations

### 2. Story-to-Worktree Mapping

#### 2.1 Load Parallel Story Definitions
- Read all stories marked for parallel development
- Extract module/component boundaries for each story
- Identify shared dependencies and integration points
- Map stories to optimal worktree configurations

#### 2.2 Worktree Naming Strategy
Generate consistent naming convention:
- **Branch Naming**: `feature/epic{X}-story{Y}-{short-description}`
- **Worktree Directory Naming**: `worktree-epic{X}-story{Y}`
- **Integration Branch Naming**: `integration/epic{X}-parallel-set{N}`

### 3. Worktree Setup Plan

#### 3.1 Generate Setup Commands
For each parallel story, generate Git commands:

```bash
# Create worktree for Story 1-1
git worktree add ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story1 -b feature/epic1-story1-user-auth
cd ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story1

# Create worktree for Story 1-2  
git worktree add ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story2 -b feature/epic1-story2-market-data
cd ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story2

# Create worktree for Story 1-3
git worktree add ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story3 -b feature/epic1-story3-portfolio-ui
cd ../crypto_market-worktree-epic1-story3
```

#### 3.2 Development Environment Setup
For each worktree:
- **Dependency Installation**: Commands to install/update dependencies
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables and configuration files
- **Build Tool Setup**: Commands to configure build tools for the worktree
- **IDE Configuration**: Workspace setup instructions for development environment

### 4. Parallel Development Coordination

#### 4.1 Development Workflow
Define standard workflow for each worktree:

1. **Initial Setup Phase**
   - Worktree creation and environment setup
   - Dependency installation and verification
   - Initial story implementation planning

2. **Development Phase**
   - Regular commits within worktree branch
   - Periodic main branch synchronization
   - Conflict prevention measures

3. **Integration Preparation Phase**
   - Story completion verification
   - Integration testing within worktree
   - Merge conflict pre-resolution

#### 4.2 Communication Protocols
- **Daily Coordination**: Touchpoints between parallel developers
- **Integration Planning**: Coordination for merge timing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Procedures for addressing merge conflicts
- **Code Review Coordination**: Review strategies for parallel work

### 5. Integration Strategy

#### 5.1 Merge Sequence Planning
Define optimal merge order for parallel stories:
- **Priority-Based Merging**: Critical path stories merge first
- **Dependency-Based Merging**: Stories with fewer dependencies merge first
- **Risk-Based Merging**: Lower-risk stories merge first to validate process

#### 5.2 Integration Testing Strategy
- **Pre-Merge Testing**: Testing requirements before story integration
- **Integration Testing**: Testing strategy for merged parallel stories  
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring parallel stories don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Validating performance impact of parallel feature additions

### 6. Quality Assurance Procedures

#### 6.1 Individual Story QA
For each worktree/story:
- **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, static analysis
- **Unit Testing Requirements**: Story-specific test coverage requirements
- **Integration Testing**: Story integration with existing codebase
- **Documentation Updates**: Story-specific documentation requirements

#### 6.2 Parallel Development QA
- **Cross-Story Impact Analysis**: Ensuring stories don't negatively impact each other
- **API Contract Validation**: Ensuring API consistency across parallel stories
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Maintaining design consistency across parallel UI stories
- **Performance Impact Assessment**: Monitoring performance implications of parallel features

### 7. Risk Management and Contingency Plans

#### 7.1 Common Risk Scenarios
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Procedures for complex conflicts
- **Story Scope Creep**: Handling scope changes in parallel development
- **Development Velocity Mismatch**: Managing uneven completion rates
- **Integration Failures**: Procedures for failed story integrations

#### 7.2 Contingency Procedures
- **Story Rollback**: Procedures for rolling back problematic stories
- **Re-parallelization**: Strategies for re-organizing parallel development
- **Sequential Fallback**: Converting parallel stories to sequential development
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Procedures for enforcing quality standards

### 8. Generate Comprehensive Worktree Plan Document

#### 8.1 Executive Summary
- **Parallel Development Overview**: High-level strategy summary
- **Expected Benefits**: Velocity improvements and development efficiency gains
- **Resource Requirements**: Development environment and coordination requirements
- **Timeline Estimates**: Expected development and integration timelines

#### 8.2 Detailed Implementation Guide
- **Step-by-Step Setup**: Complete worktree setup instructions
- **Daily Workflow Procedures**: Standard operating procedures for parallel development
- **Integration Procedures**: Step-by-step integration and merge instructions
- **Quality Assurance Checklists**: QA procedures and validation requirements

#### 8.3 Team Coordination Guidelines
- **Role Definitions**: Responsibilities for each team member in parallel development
- **Communication Schedules**: Required touchpoints and coordination meetings
- **Decision-Making Protocols**: Procedures for resolving conflicts and making decisions
- **Progress Tracking**: Methods for monitoring parallel development progress

### 9. Generate Output
