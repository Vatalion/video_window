# Parallel Story Development Checklist

## Story Design Validation

### Parallelism Requirements
- [ ] Story can be developed independently without waiting for other stories
- [ ] Story has clearly defined module/component boundaries
- [ ] Story does not modify files that other parallel stories will modify
- [ ] Story has minimal integration dependencies with other parallel stories

### Module Boundary Definition
- [ ] Specific files/folders this story will create/modify are documented
- [ ] API endpoints/contracts this story owns are clearly defined
- [ ] UI components this story creates/modifies are specified
- [ ] Database tables/collections this story affects are documented
- [ ] Shared utilities/services this story uses (read-only) are identified

### Technical Independence  
- [ ] Story has all required data models documented in Dev Notes
- [ ] Story has complete API specifications for implementation
- [ ] Story has UI component specifications and requirements
- [ ] Story includes all necessary testing requirements
- [ ] Story references all relevant architecture documentation sources

## Git Worktree Compatibility

### Branch Strategy
- [ ] Story has unique, descriptive branch name following convention
- [ ] Branch name follows pattern: `feature/epic{X}-story{Y}-{description}`
- [ ] Story is assigned to dedicated worktree directory
- [ ] Worktree setup commands are provided and tested

### Conflict Prevention
- [ ] Story file paths do not overlap with other parallel stories
- [ ] Story database schema changes are isolated and documented
- [ ] Story API changes are backward compatible or clearly versioned
- [ ] Story configuration changes are isolated or coordinated

## Development Readiness

### Requirements Completeness
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Story has complete list of tasks and subtasks
- [ ] All external dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Story effort is appropriately sized for parallel development

### Technical Context
- [ ] Dev Notes contain all necessary technical information
- [ ] Architecture references are complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Testing requirements are specific to this story
- [ ] Integration points with existing code are documented

## Quality Assurance Preparation

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit testing requirements are defined
- [ ] Integration testing approach is documented
- [ ] Story-specific test cases are identified
- [ ] Cross-story testing impact is assessed and documented

### Code Review Readiness
- [ ] Code review criteria specific to parallel development are defined
- [ ] Review dependencies on other parallel stories are identified
- [ ] Merge conflict resolution procedures are documented
- [ ] Integration review requirements are specified

## Team Coordination

### Communication Requirements
- [ ] Story coordination touchpoints with other parallel developers are defined
- [ ] Integration dependencies with other stories are communicated
- [ ] Potential conflict areas with other stories are identified
- [ ] Escalation procedures for issues are documented

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Story progress reporting mechanisms are defined
- [ ] Integration readiness criteria are specified
- [ ] Dependencies on other story completion are documented
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans are in place

## Integration Preparation

### Merge Strategy
- [ ] Story merge order in parallel set is defined
- [ ] Pre-merge validation requirements are specified
- [ ] Integration testing strategy is documented
- [ ] Post-merge validation procedures are defined

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] Potential integration conflicts are identified
- [ ] Mitigation strategies for identified risks are documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures are defined if integration fails
- [ ] Contingency plans for development delays are specified

## Final Validation

### Story Completeness
- [ ] All sections of story template are completed
- [ ] All source references are included and accurate
- [ ] Story can be implemented without additional research
- [ ] Story aligns with epic requirements and acceptance criteria

### Parallel Development Optimization
- [ ] Story maximizes parallel development benefits
- [ ] Story minimizes coordination overhead
- [ ] Story reduces integration complexity
- [ ] Story contributes to overall development velocity improvement
