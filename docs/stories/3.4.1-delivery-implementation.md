## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validated Process Rules:**

### Development Process
- **Phase Approach**: Implement in 3 phases (Digital Delivery → Service Booking → Analytics Integration)
- **Security First**: All delivery mechanisms must prioritize security and access control
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each delivery component delivered as independently testable units
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused peer review
- **Testing Strategy**: Security → Unit → Integration → Performance → Compliance testing sequence

### Integration Rules
- **API Contracts**: All integrations must use defined API contracts with versioning
- **Error Handling**: Delivery failures must have graceful fallbacks and user notifications
- **Data Consistency**: User access rights must remain consistent across all systems
- **Performance**: Delivery operations must be optimized for mobile networks
- **Compliance**: All operations must comply with digital rights and privacy regulations

### Naming Conventions
- **File Structure**: Follow domain-based organization (`lib/features/delivery/`, `backend/services/delivery/`)
- **Component Naming**: Use descriptive names with domain prefixes (`DigitalDownloadManager`, `ServiceBookingForm`)
- **API Endpoints**: Use RESTful conventions with domain prefixes (`/api/v1/delivery/`, `/api/v1/bookings/`)
- **Database Tables**: Use underscore naming with domain prefixes (`digital_products`, `service_bookings`)

### Quality Rules
- **Security**: Regular security audits for all delivery mechanisms
- **Performance**: All delivery operations must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Testing**: Minimum 90% test coverage for all delivery logic
- **Documentation**: All APIs and delivery workflows must be documented
- **Compliance**: Regular compliance reviews for digital rights management
