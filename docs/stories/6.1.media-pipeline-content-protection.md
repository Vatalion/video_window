3. Storage lifecycle management with automated tiering, retention policies, and secure deletion of expired content.
4. CDN delivery controls with geo-restrictions, device-specific access controls, and real-time piracy detection.
5. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement AES-256-GCM encryption for all content at rest and in transit with per-content key management.
6. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive DRM with Widevine, FairPlay, and PlayReady support plus forensic watermarking.
7. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement anti-piracy measures including content fingerprinting, access pattern monitoring, and automated takedown workflows.
8. Integration with capture pipeline for seamless content flow from creation to secure delivery with end-to-end audit trails.
