## Technical Implementation Details
- **Address Validation APIs**: Integration with services like SmartyStreets, Google Maps API, or USPS Address Validation
- **Shipping Carrier APIs**: FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL, and regional carriers with secure API keys
- **Geolocation Services**: Google Maps, Mapbox for address verification and delivery optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for shipping rate caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- **Database Design**: Encrypted address storage with proper indexing for performance
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive address data, OAuth 2.0 for carrier API authentication

## Integration Points
- Address validation services (SmartyStreets, Google Maps)
- Shipping carrier APIs (FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL)
- Geolocation services (Google Maps, Mapbox)
- Order tracking systems
- International shipping compliance services
- Payment processing systems for shipping costs
- Inventory management for delivery availability
- Notification systems for delivery updates

## Team Coordination
- **Frontend Team**: Address forms, shipping selection UI (60 person-hours)
