# Story: API Testing Tools

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive API testing framework covering unit, integration, performance, security, and contract testing for quality assurance.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:**
API testing is critical for ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of the application's APIs. A comprehensive testing toolkit will help developers catch issues early and maintain high API quality standards throughout the development lifecycle. This story exists to provide developers and QA teams with the tools needed to thoroughly validate API functionality before deployment.

**PO Validation:** Robust testing infrastructure is essential for maintaining API reliability and preventing production issues.

## 3. Requirements
**Explicit Requirements (Validated by PO):**
- Implement unit testing framework for individual API endpoints
- Create integration testing suite for end-to-end API scenarios
- Set up performance testing tools for load and stress testing
- Implement security testing for authentication and vulnerability detection
- Create contract testing to ensure API compatibility
- Set up automated test execution and reporting
- Create isolated testing environments with test data management
- Implement test coverage reporting and metrics
- Set up testing tools integration with CI/CD pipeline

**Technical Requirements:**
- Support multiple testing frameworks and tools
- Provide mock servers and test fixtures
- Implement test data generation and management
- Create environment-specific test configurations
- Support parallel test execution for efficiency

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Testable Points (Ensured by QA):**
- [ ] Unit tests provide 100% coverage of all API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests validate complete end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Performance tests identify bottlenecks and scalability issues
- [ ] Security tests detect authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
- [ ] Contract tests ensure API compatibility across versions
- [ ] Test automation runs efficiently in CI/CD pipeline
