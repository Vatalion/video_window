# Story: Video Processing Services Integration

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive video processing services with FFmpeg, Cloudinary, and CDN integration for upload, transcoding, optimization, and delivery.

## 2. Context
Video processing is critical for the core functionality of the application. Users need to upload videos, have them processed into various formats and resolutions, and have them delivered efficiently across different devices and network conditions. As a video processing engineer, I need to integrate video processing services (FFmpeg, Cloudinary) so that the application can handle video uploads, transcoding, optimization, and delivery efficiently. This integration must support large file uploads, multiple format conversions, adaptive streaming, and provide reliable CDN delivery while maintaining security and performance standards.

## 3. Requirements
- **Video Upload Handling**: Implement secure video upload endpoints, set up file validation and security scanning, create upload progress tracking, implement chunked upload for large files
- **Video Transcoding**: Set up FFmpeg integration for local processing, configure Cloudinary for cloud-based processing, create transcoding pipeline for multiple formats, implement resolution and bitrate optimization
- **Video Optimization**: Implement video compression algorithms, create adaptive bitrate streaming support, set up thumbnail generation, implement video metadata extraction
- **Storage and CDN Integration**: Set up cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Cloudflare), configure CDN for video delivery, implement storage optimization and cleanup, create backup and disaster recovery procedures
- **Video Processing Queue**: Create background job processing system, implement priority-based job queuing, set up job monitoring and alerting, create job retry and failure handling
- **Video Analytics**: Implement video performance monitoring, create usage analytics and reporting, set up quality of service metrics, implement cost optimization analytics
- **Security and Compliance**: Implement content moderation and filtering, set up DRM protection for premium content, create watermarking capabilities, implement access control and permissions

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Video upload handles files up to 2GB reliably with progress tracking
- Transcoding produces multiple quality formats for different devices and bandwidths
- Video optimization reduces file size by at least 30% while maintaining quality
- CDN delivery provides fast streaming globally with proper caching
- Background processing queue handles high volume with proper prioritization
- Video analytics provide actionable insights for performance optimization
- Security measures prevent unauthorized access and content abuse
- Processing costs are optimized and monitored with usage tracking
- All video formats work across target devices and platforms

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Performance**: Optimize video processing for speed and resource efficiency
- **Scalability**: Design systems to handle high-volume video processing
- **Security**: Implement proper content validation and access controls
- **Reliability**: Ensure robust processing with proper error handling and retries
- **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize processing and storage costs
- **Quality**: Maintain video quality standards across all formats
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: Follow content moderation and copyright regulations
