# Story 11.3: Notification Preferences & Channel Management

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** user (viewer or maker),
**I want** to control which notifications I receive and through which channels,
**so that** I only get alerts that matter to me without notification fatigue

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can enable/disable notifications globally (push, email, in-app) with immediate effect across all notification types.
2. User can configure per-notification-type preferences for each channel (e.g., push for auction_won but email for shipping_reminder).
3. User can set quiet hours (start time, end time, days of week) to suppress non-critical notifications during specified periods.
4. **RELIABILITY CRITICAL**: Preference changes sync to server immediately with optimistic UI updates and rollback on failure.
5. Critical notifications (payment_received, auction_won) bypass quiet hours and cannot be disabled to protect business operations.
6. Notification preferences accessible from both Settings and Activity Feed with consistent UI and behavior.
7. User receives confirmation when preferences are saved successfully with clear indication of what changed.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 11.1 – Push Notification Infrastructure (notification delivery system)
2. Story 11.2 – In-App Activity Feed (notification center UI)
3. Story 3.5 – Account Settings Management (settings navigation structure)

## Dev Notes
- Store quiet hours in UTC on server, convert to user local time in UI
- Consider adding "Notification Preview" to test current settings
- Implement preference migration strategy for schema changes
- Add analytics to track which preferences users change most
- Consider adding preset profiles (All, Essential Only, Off except critical)
- Test quiet hours edge cases (midnight crossover, DST changes)
- Implement preference export/import for user data portability
- Add warning before disabling all notifications
