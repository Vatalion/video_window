- **Low Battery**: Test behavior under battery-critical conditions
- **Low Storage**: Verify graceful handling of storage limitations
- **Network Issues**: Test various network failure scenarios
- **App Crashes**: Validate recovery mechanisms after crashes
- **OS Interruptions**: Test behavior during OS interruptions
- **Hardware Issues**: Simulate camera/microphone failures
- **Extreme Conditions**: Test under extreme environmental conditions

#### Automation Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Automated unit tests for all business logic
- **Widget Tests**: Automated UI component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Automated workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Automated performance benchmarking
- **Device Farm**: Cloud-based device testing
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Instrumentation Requirements
- **Preview Latency**: Real-time monitoring with p50/p95 metrics and alerting
- **Tag Adoption**: Track usage rate of in-recording product tagging (target > 60%)
- **Retake Reduction**: Measure segment retake rate reduction (target > 30%)
- **Drop-off Tracking**: Monitor capture-to-publish completion funnel with exit points
- **Holdout Groups**: 5-10% user allocation for AI guidance and template testing

### Quality Assurance
- **Device Matrix**: Test on low-end, mid-range, and flagship devices across iOS/Android
- **Network Conditions**: Validate behavior on 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, and offline scenarios
- **Battery Optimization**: Ensure < 8% battery consumption per 30-minute session
- **Thermal Testing**: Verify adaptive quality degradation under sustained thermal load

## Notes
- This story builds upon the user authentication system established in Story 1.1
- Integrates with the commerce system from Story 2.2
- Requires Flutter camera plugin and video_player plugin
- Audio monitoring uses flutter_sound plugin
- Follows the established BLoC pattern for state management
- UI/UX should prioritize thumb-friendly controls for mobile devices
- Real-time preview should maintain < 100ms latency
- Quality indicators should provide actionable guidance to creators
- All recorded content should be encrypted for security compliance
- Testing should cover various device models and OS versions
- Edge cases should include low storage, battery, and network conditions
