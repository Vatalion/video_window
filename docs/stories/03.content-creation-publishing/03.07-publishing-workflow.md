# Publishing Workflow Management

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Publishing Workflow System

## Story
As a craft creator,
I want a comprehensive publishing workflow management system with one-tap publishing, drop orchestration, and shoppable integration,
so that I can efficiently publish content with automated compliance checks, momentum-building features, and immediate commerce capabilities.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Creators struggle with complex publishing processes that require manual compliance checks, slow content deployment, and disconnected commerce integration, leading to missed opportunities and user frustration.
- **Solution**: Unified workflow system with AI-powered automation, one-tap publishing, and integrated commerce capabilities that streamline content deployment while ensuring compliance and maximizing engagement.
- **Impact**: 40% reduction in publishing time, 35% increase in content compliance rate, and 25% improvement in immediate monetization through shoppable integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a creator has completed content creation, **when** they initiate one-tap publishing, **then** the system performs automated compliance checks and rights validation with 99.5% success rate within 30 seconds, including DRM validation, content moderation, and intellectual property verification
- [ ] **Given** a creator is publishing content, **when** they enable drop orchestration, **then** the system generates countdown pages with RSVP management, auto-pin functionality, and inventory integration with <100ms latency, supporting 10,000+ concurrent users
- [ ] **Given** content is ready for publishing, **when** automated compliance sweeps are triggered, **then** the system validates assets using multi-layer AI checks, routes to review squad with 95% accuracy, and provides detailed violation reports with corrective suggestions
- [ ] **Given** a publishing event is initiated, **when** shoppable overlays are activated, **then** conversion analytics are tracked in real-time with <1 second latency, including product click-through rates, add-to-cart events, and revenue attribution
- [ ] **Given** content is published successfully, **when** the momentum loop triggers, **then** celebratory micro-moments and streak rewards are displayed using progressive animations, increasing publishing frequency by 40% through gamification and social validation
- [ ] **Given** content is published, **when** highlight reel generation completes, **then** social sharing assets are automatically created and distributed to creator's connected platforms with platform-specific optimization and engagement tracking
- [ ] **Given** the publishing workflow is active, **when** any action is performed, **then** comprehensive audit trail logging captures all events with 100% accuracy for compliance tracking, including user actions, system decisions, and performance metrics
- [ ] **Given** content is live, **when** performance monitoring runs, **then** real-time engagement metrics and optimization insights are available to creators within 500ms, including view counts, engagement rates, and revenue performance with predictive analytics

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 35% increase in content publishing frequency with 25% improvement in immediate commerce conversion rates and 20% increase in average order value through shoppable integration
- **Technical Metric**: 99.5% publishing success rate with p95 end-to-end latency < 5 minutes, 99.9% uptime for publishing services, and automated retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **User Metric**: 40% reduction in publishing friction with 90% creator satisfaction, 30% increase in content retention rate, and 50% improvement in creator confidence levels
- **Compliance Metric**: 95% reduction in compliance violations, 100% audit trail coverage, and 30-second average resolution time for compliance issues

## Technical Requirements

- Auto-generated highlight reel creation using flutter_ffmpeg for video processing with GPU acceleration and adaptive quality optimization
- Real-time performance monitoring using Firebase Analytics, custom Dart logging, and Prometheus integration with Grafana dashboards
- Comprehensive audit trail using Firestore security rules, Cloud Functions for compliance, and immutable event sourcing for audit integrity
- Workflow state management using Riverpod with proper transition validation, error handling, and saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Integration with child stories using dependency injection for clear ownership boundaries and pub/sub messaging for event-driven architecture
- Performance optimization using lazy loading, pagination, and caching strategies with Redis for high-frequency data access
- Security implementation using OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and end-to-end encryption for sensitive content and commerce data
