# 03.99 — Pilot: Creator Studio MVP

Status: Draft → InProgress → Ready for Review → Done

## Summary
Allow creators to create a project, upload media (photos, videos, notes), auto-generate a creation history page, compose a short video from uploaded clips, add tags/name/description, and publish to the feed with a product overlay linking to item details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Creator can create a project and see it in the studio list.
- Creator can upload media assets (images/videos) and notes; assets appear in a timeline/history view.
- Creator can compose a short video by selecting/trimming clips from uploads.
- Creator adds tags, name, and description to the short video/item.
- Publishing shows the video in the feed with a clickable overlay linking to item details.
- If an auction is active for the item, the overlay shows an active badge/timer; "Propose bid" navigates to auction/bids history.
- Basic content ownership attestation prior to publish.

## Telemetry
- creator_project_created, media_asset_uploaded, short_video_composed, creator_publish, item_overlay_clicked.

## Notes
- MVP can use server-side composition or on-device trimming; choose via spike.
- Restrict publishing to pilot allowlist.
