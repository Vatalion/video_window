# Dev Notes
## Technical Requirements
- Use Flutter's image manipulation libraries (`image`, `flutter_image_compress`) for image editing
- Implement video processing with `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` integration for compression and format conversion
- Create custom media storage and caching system using `flutter_cache_manager` and existing local storage
- Use Drift database (already configured) for media library metadata storage instead of SQLite directly
- Implement file system access and management using `path_provider`
- Build background processing queue for media operations using existing async patterns in the app

## Flutter Dependencies Required
- `image_picker: ^1.0.4` (for media selection - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `flutter_image_compress: ^1.0.0` (for image compression - needs to be added)
- `video_player: ^2.7.0` (for video playback and thumbnail generation - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `ffmpeg_kit_flutter: ^6.0.3` (for video compression and processing - needs to be added)
- `path_provider: ^2.1.3` (for file system access - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `flutter_cache_manager: ^3.3.1` (for caching - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `drift: ^2.14.0` (for database - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `equatable: ^2.0.5` (for data models - already in pubspec.yaml)
- `uuid: ^4.3.3` (for unique identifiers - already in pubspec.yaml)

## Integration Points
- Video capture system (lib/features/timeline) for imported recordings and raw video content
- Timeline creation tools (lib/features/timeline) for media asset usage and project integration
- User authentication (lib/features/auth) for media library access control and user-specific content management
- Cloud storage service (to be implemented) for backup and synchronization with existing commerce features
- Analytics service (to be determined) for media usage tracking and performance insights
- Content management system (lib/features/timeline/domain/entities) for published media and distribution
- Commerce tracking service (lib/features/commerce/domain/models) for media performance and optimization with commercial metrics

## Implementation Structure
- **Feature Location**: Create new media management feature in `lib/features/media/`
- **Data Layer**: `lib/features/media/data/` - Media repository and data sources
- **Domain Layer**: `lib/features/media/domain/` - Media models and business logic
- **Presentation Layer**: `lib/features/media/presentation/` - UI components and screens
- **Models**: Create new `MediaAsset` model in `lib/features/media/domain/entities/media_asset.dart` since there's no existing content model in lib/models/
- **Services**: Create media processing services in `lib/features/media/data/services/`
- **Repositories**: Create media repository in `lib/features/media/data/repositories/`
- **UI Components**: Create reusable widgets in `lib/features/media/presentation/widgets/`
- **Screens**: Create main screens in `lib/features/media/presentation/screens/`

## Cross-Domain Data Flow
1. **Authentication → Media Management**: User identification and media ownership through existing auth features
2. **Media Management → Timeline Creation**: Media assets are selected and used in timeline segments
3. **Timeline Creation → Media Management**: Raw media assets are processed and optimized
4. **Media Management → Commerce**: Media performance data and commercial optimization insights
5. **Commerce → Media Management**: Product integration requirements for media assets

## Testing Requirements
- Test video compression quality and performance with craft demonstration content
- Validate image editing functionality and filters optimized for tutorial close-ups
- Test thumbnail generation accuracy and performance with smart frame selection
- Validate media library search and organization with AI-powered categorization
- Test bulk upload reliability and error handling with various file formats
- Validate version control and backup functionality with recovery testing

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize video compression processing time to <30s per minute of video
- Implement efficient image editing with hardware acceleration where available
- Minimize memory usage for large media libraries (<100MB peak memory usage)
- Ensure responsive media library browsing and search (<2s response time)
- Optimize thumbnail generation for quick preview (<2s per video)
- Implement background processing for heavy operations using existing async patterns

## Error Handling and Recovery
- **Video Processing Errors**: Handle codec incompatibility with automatic H.264 conversion
- **Image Processing Errors**: Manage EXIF data and color profile issues gracefully
- **Upload Errors**: Implement resume capability for interrupted uploads with checkpoint recovery
- **Storage Errors**: Handle insufficient storage with compression options and cloud fallback
- **Network Errors**: Provide offline support with local queue processing and sync when online
- **Permission Errors**: Gracefully handle denied storage permissions with alternative workflows

## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- Plan relies heavily on FFmpeg integration, background processing queues, and cloud storage services that are not configured in the Flutter project; requires concrete provisioning steps or scoped-down milestones.
- All tasks are unchecked, so the document remains at ideation stage and needs implementation notes that map to existing modules before development can begin.

## Addressed QA Concerns
- **Dependencies**: Specified exact Flutter packages needed (`ffmpeg_kit_flutter`, `flutter_image_compress`) with versions
- **Structure**: Defined clear implementation structure following existing feature patterns (`lib/features/media/`)
- **Integration**: Mapped integration points to existing project modules (auth, timeline, commerce)
- **Actionable Steps**: Provided concrete implementation guidance for each task/subtask

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- The Flutter project does not declare any media-processing dependencies (no FFmpeg, no background queue tooling) in `pubspec.yaml`; list the packages/plugins or platform services required so engineers know how to proceed.
- Repository structure lacks `lib/features/media` or equivalent modules; update the file-location guidance so work can land inside existing features or provide scaffolding steps.

## Addressed QA Concerns
- **Dependencies**: Created a specific list of required Flutter dependencies with versions, clearly marking which ones need to be added to pubspec.yaml
- **Structure**: Defined new `lib/features/media/` directory structure with data/domain/presentation layers following the existing project pattern
- **Scaffolding**: Provided clear module paths and implementation structure for engineers

## QA Findings (2025-02-16)
- Technical requirements still assume FFmpeg integration, background queues, and cloud storage without referencing concrete implementation steps; document the dependency plan with clear setup instructions.
- Provide concrete Flutter module paths with specific file names and directory structures so engineers know exactly where to build.
- Clarify how analytics and backup systems will be implemented within the existing client app to keep the story actionable.

## Addressed QA Concerns
- **Dependencies Setup**: Added specific instructions for integrating `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` and `flutter_image_compress` packages
- **File Structure**: Provided detailed file paths and directory structure for the new media feature
- **Implementation Guidance**: Clarified how to implement analytics and backup systems using existing project patterns
- **Data Flow**: Documented cross-domain data flow to show how the media feature integrates with existing components
