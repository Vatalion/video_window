# Story 3.8: Content Scheduling System

## 1. Title
Cross-platform content scheduling and calendar orchestration for craft tutorials and shoppable stories.

## 2. Context
Creators on Video Window need the ability to plan, stage, and automatically publish their craft tutorials across channels. During discovery interviews we learned that 76% of creators batch-produce content on weekends but want it to go live at audience-specific peak times. Without tooling they rely on spreadsheets and reminder apps, leading to missed launches, inconsistent posting cadence, and lower conversion on commerce attachments. The scheduling system extends the publishing workflow (Story 3.7) by adding calendar-based planning, timezone intelligence, conflict prevention, and automation hooks into notification, monetization, and analytics pipelines.

Business goals:
- Increase creator publishing consistency by 40% within three months of release.
- Lift average tutorial engagement by 25% through optimized post times.
- Reduce manual coordination effort for creator teams by 60% (baseline: hours spent arranging launches).
- Ensure shoppable content drops align with promotional events and supply availability.

Dependencies:
- Publishing workflow orchestration (03.07-publishing-workflow.md)
- Draft management and version history (03.07.01-draft-management.md)
- Material availability and pricing services (03.05-material-specification.md, 05.05-pricing-tax-engine.md)
- Notification system for reminders (06.05-notifications-messaging.md)

## 3. Requirements
**Validated by Product & PM**

### Core Scheduling Features
- Calendar view (month/week/day) with drag-and-drop scheduling of drafts.
- Timezone-aware scheduling per creator with automatic daylight savings adjustments.
- Posting cadence templates (e.g., "Tue/Thu 7pm UTC-5") and reusable launch plans.
- Conflict detection for overlapping slots, dependent stories, or exhausted inventory.
- Bulk scheduling for multi-part series or seasonal campaigns.
- Scheduling metadata (target platforms, tags, feature flags) stored with the publish job.

### Automation & Integration
- Auto-trigger publishing pipeline at scheduled time with retry & alerting.
- Pre-launch validation checklist (assets complete, compliance approvals, inventory levels).
- Integration with notification service to send reminders to collaborators and marketing.
- Optional syndication hooks to external social channels and email campaigns.
- API endpoints for external tooling (creator agency dashboards) to manage schedules.

### Collaboration & Governance
- Role-based permissions: creators, editors, marketing, legal can propose/approve slots.
- Audit log for schedule changes with who/when/why metadata.
- Commenting and task assignment directly on scheduled entries.
- Freeze windows for high-traffic events (admins can lock schedule during launches).

### Analytics & Optimization
- Recommended publish windows based on historic engagement, region, and category.
- Post-launch performance loop: automatically annotate calendar entries with CTR, retention, revenue metrics.
- Exportable schedule (CSV/ICS) for stakeholders.

### Technical & Non-functional
- SLA: schedule execution jitter < 30 seconds under normal load.
- Highly available job dispatcher (99.9%) with graceful degradation if publishing service degraded.
- Secure handling of collaborator comments and embargoed content.
- Full audit trail retained for 18 months for compliance.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. **Calendar Management** – Creators can view and reschedule drafts via drag-and-drop with instant conflict feedback.
2. **Timezone Accuracy** – Scheduled posts publish at the correct local time regardless of creator or audience timezone settings.
3. **Validation Gate** – Scheduled entries must pass asset/compliance/inventory checks before activation; failures surface actionable errors.
4. **Bulk Scheduling** – Users can select at least five drafts and assign recurring cadence in one action.
5. **Automation Resilience** – If publishing fails, the system retries per policy and alerts responsible collaborators.
6. **Permission Controls** – Only users with scheduling rights can modify entries; others can comment or request changes.
7. **Audit History** – Every schedule change is logged and viewable in an audit timeline.
8. **Analytics Feedback** – After publish, the entry displays engagement metrics pulled from analytics service.
9. **Export & API** – Users can export schedule to ICS/CSV and manage schedules via REST API endpoints with token auth.
10. **Recommendation Engine** – System suggests top three publish windows based on past performance and target audience.

## 5. Process & Rules
**Scrum Master & Compliance Sign-off**

- Scheduling actions require drafts in "Ready" state; workflow enforces Draft → Review → Scheduled transitions.
- Conflicting slots must be resolved (reassign time or secure override approval) before publishing pipeline accepts job.
- Legal/compliance review required for content tagged as sponsorship or featuring regulated materials.
- Holds on schedule apply automatically if dependency stories slip or inventory data shows out-of-stock variants.
- API operations are rate limited and require OAuth 2.0 client credentials.

## 6. Tasks / Breakdown
- **Scheduling UI & Calendar Components** (Flutter web/mobile)
  - Build reusable calendar widgets with drag-and-drop interactions.
  - Implement timezone selector, template manager, and conflict indicators.
- **Scheduling Service & Job Dispatcher**
  - Create scheduling microservice with persistent queue and retry policies.
  - Integrate validation checks (assets, compliance, inventory) before enqueue.
- **Collaboration Features**
  - Add comment threads, mentions, and approval workflows to scheduled entries.
  - Implement permissions matrix and audit trail storage.
- **Recommendations & Analytics Loop**
  - Train/update recommendation model using engagement telemetry.
  - Surface insights in UI and add post-launch metric aggregation.
- **Integrations & API Surface**
  - Extend publishing API to manage schedules (CRUD) with swagger documentation.
  - Connect notifications service for reminders and failure alerts; add ICS/CSV export pipeline.
- **Testing & Observability**
  - Unit/integration tests for scheduling logic, retries, and permission guards.
  - Synthetic monitoring for publish jitter and failure scenarios.
