**Refinement Date:** 2025-09-22
**Readiness Score:** 95/100

## Story
As a craft creator,
I want an AI-powered content scheduling system with optimal timing recommendations, inventory-aware orchestration, and community momentum-building features,
so that I can maximize content engagement, drive commerce conversions, and build audience anticipation through intelligent scheduling and automated drop management.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Creators struggle with optimal posting timing, inventory coordination, and building momentum for drops, leading to missed engagement opportunities and inconsistent revenue streams
- **Solution**: AI-powered scheduling system that learns from audience behavior, coordinates with inventory availability, and automates momentum-building features to maximize impact
- **Impact**: 40% increase in content engagement rates, 25% improvement in drop conversion rates, and 60% reduction in scheduling overhead for creators

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator with content ready to publish, **When** I request scheduling recommendations, **Then** the system provides AI-powered optimal timing slots with 85% accuracy prediction rate, includes a 5% holdout for experimentation, and delivers recommendations in <2 seconds on mobile networks
- [ ] **Given** I have scheduled content with product drops, **When** inventory levels change, **Then** the system automatically validates availability and provides go/no-go recommendations with <500ms response time, includes real-time push notifications for critical inventory changes, and maintains 99.9% synchronization accuracy
- [ ] **Given** I am scheduling a major product drop, **When** I set the drop time, **Then** the system creates automated follower reminders, RSVP nudges, and countdown timers that achieve 30% higher attendance rates, supports biometric authentication for exclusive drops, and handles 10,000+ concurrent users during peak events
- [ ] **Given** I have scheduling gaps in my content calendar, **When** I request gap filling, **Then** the system suggests remix opportunities, creator collaborations, and trending content ideas with 70% acceptance rate, includes social proof indicators, and provides offline capability for content planning
- [ ] **Given** I am managing multiple platforms, **When** I schedule content, **Then** the system handles timezone conversion with automatic detection, detects conflicts with visual indicators, ensures cross-platform consistency with 99.9% accuracy, and provides unified analytics across all platforms
- [ ] **Given** I need to schedule content in bulk, **When** I upload multiple items, **Then** the system processes 1000+ items with automated optimization and recurring cadence management, includes drag-and-drop calendar interface, and provides progress tracking with background processing
- [ ] **Given** I want to involve my community in scheduling, **When** I enable collaborative scheduling, **Then** followers can vote on preferred times and receive personalized notifications with 40% engagement rate, includes real-time voting results, and provides social sharing capabilities for scheduled events
- [ ] **Given** I am working with a team, **When** we collaborate on scheduling, **Then** the system provides real-time updates, approval workflows, and task assignments with <100ms latency, includes role-based permissions, and maintains audit trails for all scheduling changes
- [ ] **Given** I need to modify scheduled content, **When** I make changes to timing or content, **Then** the system automatically notifies affected followers, reschedules dependent content, and provides impact analysis with engagement prediction adjustments
- [ ] **Given** I experience network connectivity issues, **When** I access the scheduling system, **Then** the system provides offline capability with local persistence, automatic synchronization when connection is restored, and maintains 99.5% data consistency across online/offline states
