- **Memory Exhaustion**: Detect memory constraints during timeline operations and automatically offload non-essential preview data to temporary storage while maintaining core editing functionality using Flutter's memory management
- **UI Responsiveness Issues**: When drag-and-drop operations exceed 100ms response time, implement visual feedback indicating processing state and queue operations for smoother user experience using Flutter's async/await patterns
- **Preview Generation Failures**: Handle video preview generation failures with placeholder thumbnails and automatic retry mechanisms (up to 3 times) before notifying user using Flutter's image error handling
- **Segment Loading Errors**: When video segments fail to load, show error indicators on affected segments with options to reload, replace, or remove them using Flutter's error handling widgets
- **Playback Synchronization Issues**: Detect and correct timeline playback synchronization problems with automatic track realignment and user notification using video_player package error handling

### Data Integrity and Backup Errors
- **Project Save Failures**: When timeline projects fail to save, implement automatic retry (up to 3 times) with local caching and user notification of status using Flutter's async error handling
- **Backup Creation Errors**: Handle timeline backup failures with automatic retry scheduling and user alerts about backup status using local storage error handling
- **Version Control Errors**: When timeline version history cannot be maintained, log errors and preserve current version while attempting to restore version control using drift database error handling
- **Metadata Corruption**: Detect and handle timeline metadata corruption with automatic reconstruction from available data and user verification using JSON parsing error handling
- **Storage Quota Exceeded**: When local or cloud storage quotas are exceeded, provide clear user notifications with storage cleanup recommendations using path_provider error handling

### Integration Errors
