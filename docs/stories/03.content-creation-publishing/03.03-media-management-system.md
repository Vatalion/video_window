## Dev Notes

### Feature Architecture
The media management system should follow the existing feature directory structure pattern:
- `/lib/features/media/` - Main feature directory
  - `data/` - Repository and data source implementations
    - `repositories/` - MediaRepository for handling media operations
    - `datasources/` - Local and remote data sources for media storage
    - `models/` - Media asset models extending existing Content models
  - `domain/` - Business logic, entities, and use cases
    - `entities/` - Media entities (VideoAsset, ImageAsset, etc.)
    - `usecases/` - Media processing use cases (compress, edit, generateThumbnails)

### State Management Approach
Use the existing BLoC pattern as implemented in other features:
- Create `MediaLibraryBloc` for managing media library state (search, filter, sort)
- Create `MediaProcessingBloc` for handling compression/editing operations (progress, status)
- Create `MediaUploadBloc` for managing bulk upload processes (queue, progress, errors)
- Follow the pattern established in `/lib/features/publishing/presentation/bloc/`

### Key Dependencies
