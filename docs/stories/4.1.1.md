# Dev Notes
## Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/commerce/payment-processing/
- Test standards: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Pytest for backend
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use:
  - Unit tests for payment logic
  - Integration tests for payment gateways
  - Security tests for PCI compliance
  - Performance tests for transaction processing

## Technical Requirements
- Use payment gateway APIs (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Implement proper encryption and tokenization
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Use secure coding practices
- Implement proper audit logging

## Integration Points
- Payment gateway services
- Fraud detection systems
- Authentication services
- Order processing system
- Analytics service
