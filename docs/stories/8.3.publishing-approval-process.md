# Story 8.3: Publishing Approval Process

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** maker,
**I want** to understand the approval process for my published content,
**so that** I can ensure compliance and track publication status

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Maker can see publication status (draft, pending_review, approved, published, rejected) with visual indicators and status definitions in maker dashboard.
2. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Maker receives real-time updates on approval progress via WebSocket connection with sub-second notification latency for status changes.
3. If rejected, maker can see specific feedback with violation categories, suggested corrections, and one-click resubmission workflow after addressing issues.
4. Maker can track average approval time and success rate in analytics dashboard with historical trends and comparative benchmarks.
5. Maker can withdraw story from review queue before admin decision with confirmation dialog and draft restoration.
6. Approved stories show publication timestamp, feed placement position, and initial engagement metrics (views, offers) in story detail view.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 8.1 – Publishing Workflow Implementation (publication status management)
2. Story 8.2 – Content Moderation Pipeline (moderation review and feedback system)
3. Story 11.1 – Notification System (real-time status notifications)
4. Story 3.1 – Viewer Profile Management (maker dashboard infrastructure)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- This is the third story in Epic 8, providing maker-facing visibility into the moderation process built in Story 8.2. It completes the feedback loop between moderation decisions and maker actions.

### Data Models
- `Story` entity includes `moderation_history` JSONB array tracking all status transitions with timestamps and reviewer notes. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Approval Process]
- `ResubmissionAttempt` tracks correction cycles: story_id, attempt_number, submitted_at, changes_summary, previous_rejection_reason. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Approval Process]
- Analytics aggregates: maker approval_rate, avg_review_duration_minutes, total_submissions, successful_publications. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Approval Process]

### API Specifications
- `GET /stories/{id}/status` returns current status, review progress, estimated completion time, and moderation feedback if rejected. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Approval Process]
- `POST /stories/{id}/resubmit` transitions rejected story back to pending_review with resubmission metadata and incremented attempt counter.
- `POST /stories/{id}/withdraw` removes story from moderation queue and transitions to draft status with withdrawal timestamp.
- `GET /makers/{id}/publication-analytics` returns aggregated publication metrics with time-series data for dashboard visualizations.

### Component Specifications
- Publication status UI components in `video_window_flutter/packages/features/publishing/lib/presentation/widgets/`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Source Tree]
- Analytics dashboard in `video_window_flutter/packages/features/publishing/lib/presentation/pages/publication_analytics_dashboard.dart`.
- WebSocket integration leverages existing real-time infrastructure from notification system (Epic 11).
- Server endpoints in `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/story/` handle status queries, resubmission, and withdrawal workflows.
- Integration with analytics infrastructure from Epic 17 for historical metrics and trend analysis.
