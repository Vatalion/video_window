# Video Window Story Library

## 📚 Overview
This library gathers every user story, implementation spec, and operational playbook that drives the Video Window product. Files now live inside epic-specific folders so product, engineering, QA, and operations teams can navigate by capability area.

## 🏗️ File Structure & Naming
- **Path pattern:** `docs/stories/<epic-id>.<epic-slug>/<epic-id>.<feature-id>[.<sub-id>]-<descriptor>.md`
- **Numbering:** two-digit feature and sub-ids (e.g. `05.08`, `05.08.01`) keep lexicographical order aligned with delivery sequencing.
- **Descriptors:** short, action-focused kebab-case phrases that match the story title.

### Example
```
docs/stories/
  05.checkout-fulfillment/
    05.01-multi-step-checkout.md
    05.05-pricing-tax-engine.md
    05.08.01-flexible-payment-implementation.md
```

### File Types
- **Feature Stories (`<epic>.<feature>.md`)** — PO/PM facing scope; required for every major outcome.
- **Implementation Slices (`<epic>.<feature>.<sub>.md`)** — technology-specific breakdowns owned by engineering.
- **Epic Overviews (`<epic>.<slug>.md`)** — optional primers that stitch multiple stories together (e.g. native app epic overview).

## 🧭 Epic Map

| 09 Platform & Infrastructure | `09.platform-infrastructure` | APIs, partner integrations, developer ecosystem, data and storage services. |

## 🔍 Navigation & Dependencies
1. **Start with epic folder** that matches the capability you’re delivering.
2. **Read feature story** (`<epic>.<feature>.md`) for business context, requirements, and ACs.
3. **Review implementation slice(s)** for technical guardrails or platform-specific detail.
4. **Follow cross references** in the `Related Files` section; all links use the new folder paths.
5. **Respect dependency order:** platform (09) → identity (01) → catalog/content (02/03) → discovery (04) → checkout (05) → engagement/admin/mobile.

## 📝 Contributing New Stories
1. Pick the right epic folder and next available feature/sub-id.
2. Copy `story-template.md` and rename it to the target pattern.
3. Complete the eight canonical sections (Title → Notes) with agent validation tags.
4. Add or update cross references so adjacent stories stay connected.
5. Mention the addition in the epic’s Change Log (or create one) to help QA trace scope.

## ✅ Quality Expectations
- Every story must declare status, priority, dependencies, and measurable acceptance criteria.
- Layout should pass accessibility guidelines (e.g. heading cascade, table semantics).
- Keep descriptors neutral—avoid platform-specific verbiage unless a slice demands it.
- Update this README when you introduce a new epic folder or structural convention.

## 🤝 Roles & Responsibilities
- **Product Owners:** confirm business value, requirements, and release sequencing.
- **Project Managers / Scrum Masters:** enforce structure, naming, and dependency hygiene.
- **Engineering Leads:** own implementation slices and ensure technical completeness.
- **QA & Analytics:** verify acceptance criteria, instrumentation, and operational readiness.
