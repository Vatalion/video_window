# Video Window Project - Stories Documentation

## üìö Overview

This directory contains all user stories and implementation guides for the Video Window project. The documentation is organized to serve both business stakeholders and technical development teams.

## üèóÔ∏è File Structure & Naming Convention

### Standardized Naming Pattern

```
[Primary].[Secondary].[Domain].[Type].md
```

### File Categories

#### 1. Core User Stories
**Format:** `[Primary].[Secondary].md`
**Purpose:** Business-facing user stories with requirements, acceptance criteria, and validation
**Audience:** Product Owners, Project Managers, QA, Stakeholders

**Examples:**
- `1.1.md` - User Registration System
- `2.1.md` - Video Content Creation
- `4.1.md` - Payment Processing

#### 2. Implementation Sub-Stories
**Format:** `[Primary].[Secondary].[Sub-story].md`
**Purpose:** Technical implementation details for complex features with multiple components
**Audience:** Development Teams, Technical Leads

**Examples:**
- `2.1.1.md` - Video Capture Interface
- `6.1.1.md` - Real-time Monitoring System
- `7.1.1.md` - Android App Implementation

#### 3. Domain-Specific Implementation Guides
**Format:** `[Primary].[Secondary].[Domain].implementation.md`
**Purpose:** Technical specifications for domain-specific implementations
**Audience:** Development Teams, System Architects

**Examples:**
- `1.1.1-commerce-implementation.md` - Commerce Product Creation
- `2.1.1.1-video-implementation.md` - Video Capture Technical Details
- `3.1.1-search-implementation.md` - Search System Implementation

## üìñ Story Structure Standards

Every core user story follows the standardized 8-section format:

### Sections (In Order)
1. **Title** - Short, clear, single-sentence summary
2. **Context** - Background and motivation, why the story exists
3. **Requirements** - Explicit requirements validated by PO
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable points ensured by QA
5. **Process & Rules** - Workflow/process notes, validated by SM
6. **Tasks / Breakdown** - Clear steps for implementation and tracking
7. **Related Files** - Links to other files with the same number
8. **Notes** - Optional, for clarifications and consolidation logs

### Agent Role Validation
Each story section is validated by specific agent roles:
- **PO (Product Owner)**: Validates requirements and business value
- **PM (Project Manager)**: Enforces structure, scope, and clarity
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Verifies acceptance criteria are testable
- **SM (Scrum Master)**: Enforces naming, rules, and consistency

## üîç File Navigation Guide

### Finding Stories
- **Main stories**: Look for `[number].[number].md` files
- **Sub-stories**: Look for `[number].[number].[number].md` files
- **Implementation guides**: Look for files ending in `implementation.md`

### Understanding Relationships
- Stories with the same primary/secondary numbers are related
- Sub-stories (3-level numbers) implement specific aspects of main stories
- Implementation guides provide technical details for specific domains

### Working with Stories
1. **Start with core stories** (`1.1.md`, `2.1.md`, etc.) for business requirements
2. **Review sub-stories** for technical implementation details
3. **Consult implementation guides** for domain-specific specifications
4. **Follow acceptance criteria** for testing validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Story Independence
- Each story is designed to be completely independent
- All necessary context and requirements are embedded within the file
- Stories are ready for parallel development work

### Cross-References
- Check the "Related Files" section for dependencies
- Update cross-references when renaming or moving files
- Maintain consistent naming when adding new stories

### Quality Standards
- All stories follow the 8-section format
- Requirements are PO-validated and testable
- Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- Technical specifications include implementation details

## üìù Adding New Stories

1. **Follow naming convention**: Use `[Primary].[Secondary].[Domain].[Type].md`
2. **Use 8-section structure**: Ensure all required sections are included
3. **Include agent validation**: Mark sections with appropriate agent roles
4. **Update cross-references**: Add links to related stories
5. **Update README**: Document new story categories if needed

## üîß File Maintenance

### Renaming Files
- Update internal references when renaming
- Check cross-references in related stories
- Update any build scripts or tooling references

### Removing Files
- Verify no other stories reference the file
- Update README if removing entire categories
- Archive rather than delete if possible

### Quality Checks
- Verify naming consistency across all files
- Ensure cross-references are accurate
- Confirm all stories follow the 8-section format

## ü§ù Team Responsibilities

### Product Owners (PO)
- Validate requirements in core stories
- Ensure business value and user needs are addressed
- Review acceptance criteria for completeness

### Project Managers (PM)
- Enforce story structure and scope
- Ensure clarity and consistency across stories
- Manage dependencies and timelines

### Quality Assurance (QA)
- Verify acceptance criteria are testable
- Ensure testing requirements are comprehensive
- Validate implementation meets specifications

### Scrum Masters (SM)
- Enforce naming conventions and process rules
- Ensure consistency across all documentation
- Facilitate team adherence to standards
