## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** business administrator,

4. Promotional campaigns management with scheduling and performance tracking
5. Rule testing and simulation before deployment
6. Rule versioning and rollback capabilities
7. Rule performance monitoring and analytics
8. Rule dependency mapping and impact analysis
9. Rule approval workflow with role-based permissions
10. Integration with payment and shipping systems for real-time rule application

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/business-rules/
- Test standards: Rule validation tests, calculation tests, integration tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E rule management workflows
- Include tests for rule calculations, targeting, and integration scenarios
