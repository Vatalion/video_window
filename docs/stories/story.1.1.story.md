# Story 1.1 - User Registration System

## 1. Title
Implement a secure user registration system with email/phone verification and COPPA compliance.

## 2. Context
New users need to create secure accounts to access platform features. The registration system must support multiple verification methods while ensuring security, regulatory compliance, and a smooth user experience. This foundational story enables user onboarding and is critical for platform adoption.

## 3. Requirements
- **PO Validated Requirements:**
  - Users must register using either email address or phone number
  - Password must meet minimum strength requirements
  - Email verification must send confirmation links to user's email
  - Phone verification must send SMS codes to user's phone
  - Users must complete verification before gaining full access
  - Age verification and consent collection for COPPA compliance
  - Progressive profile completion with save and resume functionality
  - Automated resend capabilities for verification emails/SMS
  - Account lockout protection after failed registration attempts

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **QA Verified Testable Criteria:**
  1. Users can register using email address and password
  2. Users can register using phone number and password
  3. Email verification sends a confirmation link to the user's email
  4. Phone verification sends an SMS code to the user's phone
  5. Users must complete verification before gaining full access
  6. Password must meet minimum strength requirements
  7. Age verification and consent collection for COPPA compliance
  8. Progressive profile completion with save and resume functionality
  9. Automated resend capabilities for verification emails/SMS
  10. Account lockout protection after failed registration attempts

## 5. Process & Rules
- **SM Validated Process:**

## QA Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Compilation Errors**: Multiple import path errors prevent any code compilation or testing
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Key model classes (SocialAccountModel, SocialProvider) referenced but not implemented
3. **Test Suite Failure**: All test files fail to compile - claimed 95% coverage is inaccurate
4. **Security Gaps**: No account lockout protection, missing password hashing implementation

### Acceptance Criteria Status:
- **1/10 Fully Implemented**: Only password strength validation works correctly
- **8/10 Partially Implemented**: Basic structure exists but missing key functionality
- **1/10 Not Implemented**: Account lockout protection completely missing

### Required Actions:
- Fix all import path errors (`features_auth` → `features/auth`)
- Implement missing model classes and enums
- Add actual email/SMS service integration
- Implement account lockout protection
- Create working test suite
- Add COPPA compliance validation logic

### Security Concerns:
- No password hashing implementation
- No rate limiting on verification attempts
- Missing input sanitization

**Recommendation**: Do not proceed to production until all critical issues are resolved and comprehensive testing is completed.
