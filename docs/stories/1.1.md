# Story 1.1 - User Registration System

## 1. Title
Implement a secure user registration system with email/phone verification and COPPA compliance.

## 2. Context
New users need to create secure accounts to access platform features. The registration system must support multiple verification methods while ensuring security, regulatory compliance, and a smooth user experience. This foundational story enables user onboarding and is critical for platform adoption.

## 3. Requirements
- **PO Validated Requirements:**
  - Users must register using either email address or phone number
  - Password must meet minimum strength requirements
  - Email verification must send confirmation links to user's email
  - Phone verification must send SMS codes to user's phone
  - Users must complete verification before gaining full access
  - Age verification and consent collection for COPPA compliance
  - Progressive profile completion with save and resume functionality
  - Automated resend capabilities for verification emails/SMS
  - Account lockout protection after failed registration attempts

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **QA Verified Testable Criteria:**
  1. Users can register using email address and password
  2. Users can register using phone number and password
  3. Email verification sends a confirmation link to the user's email
  4. Phone verification sends an SMS code to the user's phone
  5. Users must complete verification before gaining full access
  6. Password must meet minimum strength requirements
  7. Age verification and consent collection for COPPA compliance
  8. Progressive profile completion with save and resume functionality
  9. Automated resend capabilities for verification emails/SMS
  10. Account lockout protection after failed registration attempts

## 5. Process & Rules
- **SM Validated Process:**
  - Follow Flutter/Clean Architecture patterns with feature-based structure
  - Use Serverpod for backend services with JWT-based authentication
  - Implement password hashing with bcrypt and TLS 1.2+ for all communications
  - Follow widget testing patterns with mocked Serverpod clients
  - Test file location: `/crypto_market/test/features/auth/`
  - Testing frameworks: Flutter test framework, mocktail for mocking
