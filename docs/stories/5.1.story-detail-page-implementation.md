# Story 5.1: Story Detail Page with Video Carousel Implementation

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** viewer,
**I want** to view a comprehensive story page with video carousel (3-7 clips), Process Timeline development journal, narrative sections, and clear call-to-action,
**so that** I can explore the artifact from multiple perspectives, understand its creation journey, and make offers or participate in auctions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete story page layout with video carousel (3-7 clips with dot navigation), section navigation (Overview, Process Timeline as vertical-scroll development journal, Materials, Notes, Location), and sticky "I want this" CTA with smooth scroll-to-offers functionality.
2. HLS video playback with adaptive streaming, watermark protection, customizable controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen, captions), and mobile-optimized gesture controls.
3. WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility including semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, captions for video content, and high contrast mode support.
4. Content protection with signed URLs, watermarking enforcement, and secure media delivery preventing unauthorized downloads and screen capture attempts.
5. Share functionality with expiring deep links, social media integration, and analytics tracking for share events and user engagement metrics.
6. Performance optimization with video preloading strategies, adaptive bitrate streaming, lazy loading for non-critical content, and efficient state management.
7. Comprehensive error handling for video playback failures, network issues, content protection violations, and graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages.
8. Analytics instrumentation for story views, video engagement metrics, section interactions, CTA clicks, and share events with proper parameter tracking.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 01.1 – Bootstrap Repository and Flutter App
2. Story 4.1 – Home Feed Implementation (navigational entry and shared video playback primitives)
3. Story 6.1 – Media Pipeline Content Protection (signed URLs, watermarking)
4. Story 9.1 – Offer Submission Flow (CTA destination contracts)

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 5.1 is the foundational story consumption experience for Epic 5, establishing the core patterns for all story-related interactions and content presentation. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-5--story-detail-playback--consumption]
- Follow sequencing and file operations defined in `docs/tech-spec-epic-5.md#implementation-guide` to keep layout, accessibility, and sharing deliverables aligned.

### Data Models
- `ArtifactStory` model contains structured sections (overview, process, materials, notes, location) and content references with status management for published stories. [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
- Story sections are stored as JSONB data with flexible schema to support various content types and future enhancements.
- Maker profile integration requires user relationship with roles and authentication state management.

### API Specifications
- `GET /stories/{id}` returns complete story metadata including sections, media references, and maker information with proper authorization checks.
- `POST /media/signed-url` generates short-lived URLs for secure video access with user-specific watermarking parameters.
- `POST /stories/{id}/share` creates expiring deep links with analytics tracking and social media metadata.

### Component Specifications
- Flutter story feature package (`video_window_flutter/packages/features/story/`) owns story detail UI, section navigation, and video player integration with BLoC-based state management. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-5--story-detail-playback--consumption]
- Video player component integrates with HLS streaming and content protection mechanisms from the media pipeline service exposed through `packages/core/` services.
- Section navigation uses shared scroll controller utilities in `packages/shared/` with position tracking and active section highlighting.
- Share functionality leverages platform-specific sharing APIs orchestrated via `packages/core/lib/data/services/sharing/`.

### File Locations
- Story presentation layer lives under `video_window_flutter/packages/features/story/lib/presentation/` (pages, widgets, BLoCs). [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Feature use cases belong in `video_window_flutter/packages/features/story/lib/use_cases/` to coordinate with repositories.
- Video playback, content protection, and analytics services remain in `video_window_flutter/packages/core/lib/data/services/`.
- Serverpod integrations reside in `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/stories/` and associated business modules.
- Tests mirror the structure under `video_window_flutter/packages/features/story/test/` and server-side tests in `video_window_server/test/endpoints/stories/`.

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain ≥80% coverage with comprehensive integration tests for story loading, video playback, and section navigation. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Story BLoCs and widgets should use bloc_test package with detailed widget tests for all user interactions and edge cases. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
- Video player testing requires integration with media pipeline simulation and mock streaming services.
- Accessibility testing should include screen reader validation and keyboard navigation verification.

### Technical Constraints
- Video streaming requires HLS support with adaptive bitrate streaming and secure token-based authentication. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#media-pipeline]
- Content protection mandates signed URLs, watermarking, and client-side capture deterrence mechanisms. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-6--media-pipeline--content-protection]
- Accessibility compliance requires WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper semantic structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. [Source: accessibility/accessibility-guide.md]
- Performance optimization requires video startup time under 2 seconds and smooth playback on 3G networks. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#performance-optimization]
- Memory usage optimization is critical for video playback with proper resource cleanup and cache management.
- Network resilience requires graceful degradation and offline support for story content viewing.

### Project Structure Notes
- Story feature aligns with the melos-managed package architecture using presentation/use-case layers only, delegating data access to `packages/core/`. [Source: architecture/package-architecture-requirements.md]
- No deviations identified from the monorepo structure and existing patterns established in other features.

### Scope Notes
- The current acceptance criteria span multiple vertical slices (layout, media playback, accessibility, content protection, social sharing). Break into incremental stories (e.g., Core Layout, Video Playback + Security, Accessibility Enhancements, Share & Analytics) to de-risk delivery.

## Testing
- Follow the project testing pipeline by running `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test --no-pub` before submission. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Add comprehensive BLoC and widget tests for story detail page including video player state, section navigation, and CTA interactions. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
- Include integration tests for video streaming with mock media pipeline and network simulation.
- Perform accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation validation.
- Test content protection mechanisms and verify secure URL handling and watermark enforcement.
