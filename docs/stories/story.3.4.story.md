# Story 3.4: Content Feed System

## 1. Title
Personalized Content Feed System with Algorithmic Ranking

## 2. Context
This story implements the core content feed system for Video Window, serving as the primary content consumption interface. The feed integrates with multiple domains including commerce and authentication to provide a unified, personalized content discovery experience. Based on market analysis showing that personalized feeds increase user engagement by 35% and time spent in-app by 28%, this system will combine algorithmic ranking, following-based content, trending content, editorial curation, and commerce integration to create a comprehensive content discovery platform.

## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validated Process Rules:**

### Development Process
- **Phase Approach**: Implement in 3 phases (Core Feed → Commerce Integration → Cross-Domain Testing)
- **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend teams work concurrently with defined API contracts
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each acceptance criteria delivered as independently testable units
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review with focus on cross-domain integration points
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit → Integration → Cross-domain → Performance testing sequence

### Integration Rules
- **API First**: All integrations must use defined API contracts with versioning
- **Error Handling**: Cross-domain failures must have graceful fallbacks
- **Data Consistency**: User data must remain consistent across all domains with conflict resolution
- **Performance**: Cross-domain calls must be optimized and cached where possible
- **Security**: All data transfers must be encrypted with proper authentication

### Naming Conventions
- **File Structure**: Follow domain-based organization (`lib/features/feed/`, `backend/services/feed/`)
- **Component Naming**: Use descriptive names with domain prefixes (`FeedContentCard`, `CommerceProductCard`)
- **API Endpoints**: Use RESTful conventions with domain prefixes (`/api/v1/feed/`, `/api/v1/commerce/`)
- **Database Tables**: Use underscore naming with domain prefixes (`feed_content`, `commerce_products`)

### Quality Rules
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage for all new code
- **Documentation**: All APIs and complex algorithms must be documented
- **Performance**: All components must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Security**: Regular security reviews for all cross-domain integrations
- **Accessibility**: All UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
