# Story: Real-time Event Streaming

## 1. Title
Implement real-time event streaming architecture with WebSocket connections, message brokers, and event processing for live updates and synchronized experiences.

## 2. Context
Real-time event streaming is crucial for features like live video interactions, real-time notifications, collaborative features, and synchronized user experiences. As a real-time systems engineer, I need to implement real-time event streaming so that the application can provide live updates, notifications, and synchronized experiences across all connected clients. This requires a robust event streaming architecture that can handle high concurrent connections, provide low latency messaging, ensure reliability, and support various event types while maintaining security and performance standards.

## 3. Requirements
- **Event Streaming Architecture**: Design event streaming system architecture, set up message broker integration (Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka), create event producer and consumer patterns, implement event routing and filtering
- **Real-time Communication**: Implement WebSocket connections, set up Server-Sent Events (SSE) support, create connection management and scaling, implement fallback mechanisms
- **Event Processing**: Create event processing pipeline, implement event transformation and enrichment, set up event aggregation and batching, create event deduplication
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement connection pooling and optimization, set up event compression and serialization, create load balancing strategies, implement caching for frequently accessed events
- **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**: Implement event persistence and recovery, set up backup and disaster recovery, create health monitoring and alerting, implement graceful degradation
- **Security and Authentication**: Implement connection authentication, set up event encryption and security, create access control and permissions, implement rate limiting for connections
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Set up event stream monitoring, create performance analytics and metrics, implement event correlation and tracing, set up capacity planning tools

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Event streaming system handles 10,000+ concurrent connections reliably
- Event latency is under 100ms for real-time features and updates
- System recovers gracefully from failures with proper failover mechanisms
- Security measures prevent unauthorized access with proper authentication
- Performance scales with user load maintaining low latency
- Monitoring provides comprehensive insights into system health
- All event types work in production with proper processing
- Fallback mechanisms work when primary systems fail
- Connection management handles disconnects and reconnects smoothly

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput
- **Reliability**: Ensure robust event delivery with proper error handling
- **Scalability**: Design systems to handle growing connection counts
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for real-time communication
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Testing**: Test real-time features thoroughly before deployment
