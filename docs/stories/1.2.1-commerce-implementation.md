# Implementation: Story 1.2 - Commerce Catalog Management

## Status
**Status:** Draft

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation depends on **Story 1.2: Social Media Authentication Integration** for user authentication and is part of the commerce system that relies on verified user accounts.

## Story

**I want** to manage and organize product catalogs with advanced filtering and categorization,
**so that** customers can easily discover and browse products.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Product listing management interface with bulk operations
2. Advanced product categorization system
3. Product filtering and search capabilities
4. Product sorting and ordering options
5. Product status management (active, inactive, archived)
6. Bulk product upload and management
7. Product export functionality
8. Catalog performance analytics
9. Product duplicate detection
10. SEO optimization tools

# Dev Notes
## Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/commerce/catalog-management/
- Test standards: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Pytest for backend
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use:
  - Unit tests for filtering and sorting algorithms
  - Integration tests for catalog management operations
  - Performance tests for large catalog operations
  - API testing for bulk operations

## Technical Requirements
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement server-side pagination and filtering
- Use ElasticSearch or similar for advanced search
- Implement proper caching strategies for performance
- Add real-time updates for catalog changes

## Integration Points
- Search engine for product discovery
- Analytics service for tracking
- Media management for product images
- User management for permissions
- Export service for data delivery

## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- Specification remains anchored to a React/ElasticSearch stack rather than the Flutter architecture in this repository; the tooling, dependency, and testing guidance must be re-authored for Flutter before execution.
- All subtasks are unchecked, indicating the plan has not progressed beyond ideation and currently provides no actionable implementation alignment with existing app modules.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- Repository inventory shows only `lib/features/{cart,device_management,profile,recovery,security,shipping}` and corresponding `test/features/...` suitesâ€”none of the `lib/features/commerce/...` or `tests/unit/commerce/...` paths listed here exist, so engineers lack a landing zone for the work.
- `pubspec.yaml` carries no React, ElasticSearch, or Node tooling; reframe the implementation around Flutter-friendly search/catalog solutions or supply a provisioning plan.
- The primary-story pointer cites social-auth Story 1.2, but this implementation describes catalog tooling; confirm the numbering/dependency chain so downstream teams know which storyline owns catalog management.
