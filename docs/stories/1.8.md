# Story 1.8 - Device Management System

## 1. Title
Security-focused device management system with trust scoring and remote control capabilities.

## 2. Context
As account security threats continue to evolve, users need comprehensive tools to monitor and control access to their accounts across multiple devices. This story addresses the critical need for device visibility, trust assessment, and remote management capabilities. The system integrates with existing authentication (Story 1.1), biometric verification (Story 1.4), session management (Story 1.5), and profile management (Story 1.7) systems to provide a unified security experience.

## 3. Requirements
**PO Validated Requirements:**
- Device fingerprinting using hardware ID, IP address, browser fingerprint, and installation ID
- Device trust scoring system (0-100) based on usage patterns and behavior analysis
- Remote device logout capabilities with confirmation dialogs
- Real-time notifications for new device login attempts (< 5 seconds)
- Custom device labeling and management interface
- Automatic device logout after 30 days of inactivity (configurable)
- Location tracking with explicit user consent
- Integration with commerce system for risk-based authentication
- All device management actions require biometric/PIN verification
- Device data encryption at rest and comprehensive audit logging

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**QA Validated Testable Criteria:**

### 4.1 Device Management Interface
- [ ] **Device List Display**: Users can view all devices connected to their account showing device name, type, last activity, location, and trust level
- [ ] **Device Labeling**: Users can assign custom names to trusted devices and edit existing device labels
- [ ] **Remote Logout**: Users can remotely logout from specific devices with confirmation dialog showing device details
- [ ] **Real-time Notifications**: Users receive push notifications within 5 seconds of new device login attempts
- [ ] **Authentication Verification**: All device management actions require biometric or PIN verification before execution

### 4.2 Device Security Intelligence
- [ ] **Device Fingerprinting**: System generates unique device fingerprints using hardware ID, IP address, browser fingerprint, and installation ID
- [ ] **Trust Scoring**: System calculates device trust scores (0-100) based on usage frequency, location consistency, and behavior patterns
- [ ] **Automatic Logout**: Devices automatically logout after 30 days of inactivity, with threshold configurable via admin settings
- [ ] **Location Tracking**: Device location tracking with explicit user consent toggle and privacy settings for location data retention
- [ ] **Security Compliance**: System implements device management security best practices including encryption, audit logging, and access controls

### 4.3 Integration Requirements
- [ ] **Profile Integration**: Device management accessible through profile management interface from Story 1.7
- [ ] **Commerce Risk Assessment**: Device trust scores below 50 trigger additional authentication for commerce transactions
- [ ] **Notification Preferences**: Device notifications respect user notification preferences configured in account settings

## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validated Workflow Rules:**

### 5.1 Device Registration Process
1. Device fingerprint generated on first login
2. User prompted to assign device name and trust level
3. Device registered with comprehensive metadata
4. Trust score initialized based on registration context

### 5.2 Device Management Rules
- All device actions require current session authentication
- Biometric/PIN verification required for sensitive operations
- Device trust scores updated based on usage patterns
- Suspicious activity triggers immediate notifications
- Location data requires explicit user consent
- Audit logging maintained for all device operations

### 5.3 Security Protocols
- Device data encrypted at rest using industry standards
- API endpoints protected by authentication middleware
- Rate limiting applied to device management operations
- Session validation for all device-related requests
- Regular security audits of device management system
