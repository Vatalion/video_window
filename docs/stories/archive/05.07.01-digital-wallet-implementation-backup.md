# Status
**Status:** Draft

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Missing `Priority`, testing summary, change log; acceptance criteria mirror parent story without measurable thresholds or instrumentation.
  - Dev Notes reference Jest/Pytest (web stack) despite Flutter appâ€”indicates template drift.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Scope duplicates parent wallet story; unclear responsibilities, no architecture references, no provider certification plan.
  - Testing guidance mismatched (React/Python) signals outdated spec; engineering cannot rely on it.
  - Lacks emphasis on habit-forming wallet flows and trust (e.g., on-video pop, loyalty boosts) critical to user retention.
  - Implementation tasks treat wallets as simple integrations without resilience or telemetry.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Need instrumentation (approval rates, wallet usage mix, failure reasons) and analytics dependencies.
  - Add compliance/legal requirements for wallet providers (domain verification, attestation) and fallback UX when wallet unavailable.
  - Provide testing and rollout strategy specific to Flutter + native SDKs, including device lab coverage.
  - Add token vault observability, one-handed gesture triggers, and fast-fail analytics for provider outages.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Plan personalized wallet suggestions and celebratory confirmation experiences to drive repeat usage.
  - Explore co-shopping features (gift wallet transfers, shared payments) to align with social commerce vision.
  - Provide ready-to-use QA scenarios across edge devices and payment states.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Test directories and frameworks cited do not exist in repo; update before implementation.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **2 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

  - Implementation tasks treat wallets as simple integrations without resilience or telemetry.

  - Provide ready-to-use QA scenarios across edge devices and payment states.

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Business Value**: Clear value proposition for digital wallet integration but lacks specific business case or ROI projections. Basic user benefit of quick checkout is well-understood.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Good coverage of core wallet functionality but lacks specific success metrics and measurable performance targets.
- **User Perspective**: Well-written from user perspective with clear scenario for quick checkout using saved payment methods.
- **Dependencies**: Major gap - testing references wrong tech stack (Jest/Pytest vs Flutter). No clear wallet provider selection or integration plan.
- **Priority Alignment**: Medium priority - important for user experience but not mission critical for initial launch.
- **Completeness**: Basic structure in place but lacks technical depth, implementation details, and mobile-specific considerations.

**Overall Rating**: **Needs Work**
**Strengths**:
- Clear user story format and perspective
- Good coverage of core wallet functionality
- Well-structured task breakdown with logical phases
- Includes basic technical requirements
- Simple and straightforward approach

**Areas for improvement**:
- Fix testing framework references (use Flutter instead of Jest/Pytest)
- Add specific wallet provider selection criteria
- Include mobile-specific implementation considerations
- Add measurable success metrics for acceptance criteria
- Define integration points and dependencies clearly

**Specific recommendations**:
- Update testing approach to use Flutter Test framework
- Define specific wallet providers and integration requirements
- Add mobile-specific wallet implementation considerations
- Include performance targets and success metrics
- Define error handling and fallback strategies
- Add security considerations for token management

**Ready for development?**: **No** - Requires technical specification updates and provider selection before development can begin.
