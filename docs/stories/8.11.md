# Story: SDK Generation and Distribution

## 1. Title
Implement multi-language SDK generation and distribution system from OpenAPI specifications for seamless developer integration.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:**
SDKs significantly lower the barrier to entry for developers integrating with the application. Automatic SDK generation from the OpenAPI specification ensures consistency and reduces maintenance overhead across multiple programming languages. This story exists to provide developers with easy-to-use, language-specific SDKs that accelerate integration and reduce development time.

**PO Validation:** SDK availability is crucial for platform adoption and developer satisfaction across different technology stacks.

## 3. Requirements
**Explicit Requirements (Validated by PO):**
- Generate SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java/Kotlin, Swift, and Dart/Flutter
- Implement automatic SDK generation from OpenAPI specifications
- Create comprehensive SDK-specific documentation and examples
- Set up automated package management and distribution
- Implement version management and backward compatibility
- Create authentication and authorization handling in all SDKs
- Implement error handling and retry logic across all platforms
- Set up automated testing and validation for all SDKs
- Provide performance optimization for each target platform

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use official OpenAPI generators where available
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Implement consistent API patterns across all SDKs
- Support all authentication methods used by the platform
- Provide comprehensive error handling and logging

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Testable Points (Ensured by QA):**
- [ ] SDKs are generated successfully for all target languages
- [ ] All SDKs implement 100% of core API functionality
- [ ] Language-specific documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Package management integration works for all platforms
- [ ] Automated tests validate SDK functionality across languages
- [ ] Version management maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet platform-specific requirements
- [ ] All SDKs work in production environments
- [ ] Installation and setup processes are documented and tested
- [ ] Error handling provides clear, actionable feedback

## 5. Process & Rules
**Workflow Process (Validated by SM):**
1. **SDK Generation Process:**
   - Generate SDKs from OpenAPI specifications
   - Validate generated code against language standards
   - Apply language-specific optimizations and customizations
   - Run automated tests and validation

2. **Quality Assurance Process:**
   - Test each SDK against actual API endpoints
   - Validate documentation accuracy and completeness
   - Performance test SDK operations
   - Security test authentication and data handling

3. **Distribution Process:**
   - Build and package SDKs for distribution
   - Publish to respective package repositories
   - Create release notes and migration guides
   - Monitor package usage and feedback

**Rules and Standards:**
- Follow semantic versioning for all SDKs
- Maintain consistent API naming across languages
- Document all breaking changes with migration guides
- Implement comprehensive error handling patterns
- Support all major versions of target languages/platforms
