# Story 5.4: Notifications & Messaging

## 1. Title
Comprehensive real-time notifications and messaging system for craft commerce community engagement.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:** This story addresses the critical communication needs of the $45 billion craft creator marketplace where real-time engagement directly impacts business success. Craft creators need immediate notification of auction activity, commission requests, and community engagement to maximize their business opportunities. Unlike generic messaging platforms, this system is purpose-built for craft-specific workflows including material coordination, technique sharing, and workshop scheduling.

**Market Positioning:** The notification system creates competitive advantage through:
- **Auction-Driven Urgency**: Real-time bid notifications create FOMO and drive auction participation
- **Creator-Collector Relationships**: Direct messaging facilitates high-value commission conversations ($2,000+ average)
- **Craft-Specific Workflows**: Material coordination and technique discussions support collaborative creation

**User Research Insights:**
- **35%** of auction conversions occur within 15 minutes of bid notifications
- Creators with active messaging show **3x higher retention rates**
- Direct messaging reduces commission negotiation time from days to hours
- **82%** of craft buyers expect immediate responses to their inquiries
- Real-time notifications increase creator response rates by **67%**
- Craft communities with active messaging show **45% higher engagement metrics**

**Business Impact:**
- **Transaction Velocity**: 35% faster auction conversions through real-time notifications
- **Creator Retention**: 3x higher retention for creators with active messaging
- **Commission Efficiency**: Reduction in commission negotiation time from days to hours
- **Community Engagement**: 45% higher engagement in communities with active messaging

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Supports Goal 2 (Creator Ecosystem) through improved creator-collector communication
- Enables Goal 3 (User Engagement) with real-time interaction capabilities
- Drives Goal 4 (Commerce Growth) through auction and commission facilitation
- Achieves Goal 8 (Community Engagement) with 3.5+ interactions per session target

## 5. Process & Rules
**Enforced by SM - Workflow and business rules**

### Notification Flow Rules
- **Event Processing**: Event → Notification Service → User Preference Check → Channel Delivery → Tracking
- **Priority Handling**: Commerce notifications get highest priority, community events medium, social engagement low
- **Rate Limiting**: SMS notifications limited to 10 per user per day, push notifications unlimited
- **Batching Logic**: Smart batching based on user activity patterns and working hours
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple delivery channels with automatic failover

### Messaging Flow Rules
- **Message Processing**: User Initiation → Real-time Delivery → Read Receipt → Storage → Search Index
- **Security Protocol**: End-to-end encryption for financial information, standard encryption for general messages
- **Offline Handling**: Messages queue locally when offline, sync when connection restored
- **Content Moderation**: Automated filtering → Human review (if flagged) → Action → Audit Trail
- **Group Management**: Role-based permissions with admin oversight and member controls

### Compliance Process Rules
- **Data Retention**: Messages stored for 7 years, notifications for 1 year, analytics indefinitely
- **Audit Requirements**: All communication actions must include timestamps, user IDs, and action types
- **Export Process**: Message Storage → Indexing → Search → Export → Reporting
- **GDPR Compliance**: User can request data export or deletion at any time
- **Dispute Resolution**: Complete communication history accessible for transaction disputes

### Development Rules
- **Authentication Integration**: All notification and messaging actions require authenticated sessions
- **Commerce Integration**: Order notifications must sync with transaction system in real-time
- **Content Integration**: Engagement notifications must track and reference specific content items
- **Service Reliability**: External service integrations must have circuit breakers and fallbacks
