# Story 5.5: Moderation & Reviews

## Status
Strategic Review Complete - Ready for Technical Implementation

## Story
**As a** craft creator, collector, and platform moderator,
**I want** to have a comprehensive moderation and review system that ensures authenticity of craft items, verifies creator quality, and builds trust in high-value transactions,
**so that** we can maintain platform integrity, protect against fraud, and establish Video Window as the most trusted destination for premium craft commerce.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Craft Authenticity Verification**: Users can report suspicious items, counterfeit claims, and authenticity disputes with craft-specific evidence requirements
2. **Creator Quality Moderation**: Moderators can review creator verification submissions, portfolio authenticity, and craft quality standards compliance
3. **Transaction-Specific Reviews**: Rating system supports craft-specific criteria (workmanship accuracy, material quality, communication, shipping/packaging)
4. **Fraud Detection AI**: Automated filtering detects suspicious bidding patterns, fake reviews, and fraudulent craft listings using craft marketplace heuristics
5. **Verified Purchase Authentication**: Review system includes auction win verification, purchase confirmation, and proof of delivery requirements
6. **Tiered Moderation Actions**: Moderation includes creator warnings, temporary suspensions, permanent bans, and auction/item removals with financial hold periods
7. **Craft-Specific Sorting**: Reviews sort by "craft expertise helpfulness", "verified purchase", and "similar item purchases"
8. **Creator Reputation Analytics**: Reputation system tracks craft-specific metrics (completion rate, quality consistency, communication responsiveness)
9. **Auction Integrity Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of auction activity for bid manipulation, shill bidding, and price gouging
10. **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Full transaction and moderation history available for dispute resolution and platform compliance

## Strategic Product Context

### Market Positioning & Competitive Analysis
This moderation and review system addresses the critical trust deficit in the $45 billion craft marketplace. Unlike Etsy's basic review system or eBay's generic feedback, Video Window's approach is purpose-built for:

1. **High-Value Transaction Protection**: Average craft transactions ($125-$180 AOV) require robust fraud prevention and authenticity verification
2. **Creator Quality Assurance**: Craft creators command premium prices only when platform trust is established through verified quality and consistent delivery
3. **Auction Integrity**: Real-time auction monitoring prevents the manipulation that plagues traditional art and craft marketplaces

### Strategic Business Impact
- **Trust Premium**: Platforms with strong verification systems command 15-25% price premiums for identical items
- **Fraud Reduction**: Comprehensive moderation reduces dispute rates by 70% and chargeback costs by 85%
- **Creator Quality**: Verified creators achieve 3x higher sales volumes and can charge 40% premium prices

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Financial Protection**: Escrow-style holds and verified delivery requirements protect both creators and collectors
- **Reputation Economy**: Creator reputation directly impacts auction success rates and commission opportunities
- **Legal Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trails satisfy FTC, GDPR, and financial regulations for marketplace transactions
