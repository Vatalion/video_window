## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- Document references numerous modules (`lib/features/personalization/`, backend/ML directories) that do not exist in this Flutter repo; implementation guidance must be mapped to actual project structure or accompanied by a plan to create those layers.
- Despite the "Ready for development" narrative, no tasks are marked complete and there is no evidence of progress beyond planning—status should remain Draft until repository alignment and dependency setup are complete.

**Overall Assessment: REQUIRES REVISION**
The strategic framing is strong, but implementation details must be reconciled with the current codebase and dependency plan before development can begin.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- The repository still lacks any `lib/features/personalization`, `backend/services/personalization`, or `backend/ml` directories; the file map needs to align with actual Flutter modules (currently `{cart,device_management,profile,recovery,security,shipping}`).
- `pubspec.yaml` has no ML/personalization packages (no recommender libraries, analytics SDKs, or experiment tooling); specify the planned dependencies so the implementation can meet the listed ACs.
- Status column at the top reads **Approved** even though all checkboxes remain unchecked—please demote to Draft or add links to delivered code/tests to avoid mis-signaling readiness.

## QA Findings (2025-02-16)
- Testing and telemetry plans reference experiment platforms and analytics services that are absent; provide concrete Flutter/Dart implementations or integration plans.
- File-location guidance still points to nonexistent personalization modules—define the real paths or outline scaffolding work.
- Clarify how privacy compliance, adaptive models, and cross-domain data flows will be achieved within the current Flutter client to keep the story actionable.
