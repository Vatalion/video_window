# Story 1.2: Add Social Sign-In Options

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** viewer,
**I want** to authenticate with Apple and Google,
**so that** I can use existing accounts seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Configure Apple Sign-In (iOS) and Google Sign-In (iOS/Android) per platform guidelines.
2. Serverpod reconciles social identities, preventing duplicate viewer accounts.
3. Fallback to email OTP if social auth fails, with analytics capturing drop-off.
4. **UNIFIED AUTH**: Uses same authentication flow as Story 1.1 - social auth creates/links accounts using same user model, with role differentiation (viewer/maker) happening post-signin.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 01.1 – Bootstrap Repository and Flutter App
2. Story 1.1 – Implement Email OTP Sign-In (shared auth services, secure storage patterns)
3. Serverpod identity module scaffolding (`video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/identity/`)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Security patterns established for OTP, JWT tokens, rate limiting, and secure storage should be extended to social authentication flows. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.implement-email-sms-sign-in.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- User model should accommodate social identity linking (Apple ID, Google ID) alongside email identities. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#user-entity]
- Social authentication tokens need temporary storage with same security patterns as JWT tokens. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#session-entity]
- Account reconciliation logic to prevent duplicate viewer accounts when same email used across social providers. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#implementation-details]

### API Specifications
- Social authentication endpoints in Serverpod for Apple Sign-In token validation. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#authentication-endpoints]
- Google Sign-In token validation endpoint. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#authentication-endpoints]
- Account reconciliation endpoint to merge/link social identities with existing accounts. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#serverpod-identity-service]
- Fallback authentication endpoint to switch to email OTP flow. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#implementation-guide]

### Component Specifications
- Social sign-in buttons follow design system tokens from `design_system/`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#implementation-guide]
- Sign-in flow orchestration uses BLoC for complex flows and StatefulWidget for simple UI state. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#implementation-details]
- Error handling for social auth failures uses shared `ErrorView` components. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#error-handling]

### File Locations
- Social auth UI components live under `video_window_flutter/packages/features/auth/lib/presentation/widgets/social_sign_in/`
- Feature BLoCs and flow orchestration belong in `video_window_flutter/packages/features/auth/lib/presentation/bloc/`
- Feature use cases are defined under `video_window_flutter/packages/features/auth/lib/use_cases/`
- Data access and provider integrations must reside in `video_window_flutter/packages/core/lib/data/services/auth/`
- Serverpod identity endpoints live in `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/identity/`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for social auth token validation and account reconciliation logic
- Integration tests for Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In flows (mocked)
- Widget tests for social sign-in UI components
- Maintain ≥80% coverage following testing strategy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#api-calls]

### Technical Constraints
- Apple Sign-In requires iOS platform-specific implementation following Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Google Sign-In requires Google Sign-In SDK integration for both iOS and Android
- Social auth tokens must follow same security patterns as JWT tokens (RS256, 15-minute expiry) [Source: docs/stories/1.1.implement-email-sms-sign-in.md#technical-constraints]
- Account reconciliation must handle edge cases: same email across providers, provider account changes, etc.
- Analytics tracking for social auth success/failure/drop-off rates
- Rate limiting should extend to social auth attempts to prevent abuse

### Project Structure Notes
- Social authentication components align with the melos-managed feature package at `video_window_flutter/packages/features/auth/`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#flutter-client]
- No deviations identified from the current monorepo structure rooted in `video_window_flutter/`. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#source-tree]
