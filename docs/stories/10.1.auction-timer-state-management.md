# Story 10.1: Auction Timer & State Management

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** marketplace participant (viewer, maker, or admin),
**I want** the auction timer to start, tick, and stay accurate in real time as soon as an auction launches,
**so that** I can trust auction countdowns and react to bids without timing surprises

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **TIMER CRITICAL**: Auction timers register automatically when Epic 9 emits `offers.auction.started`, storing start/end metadata in Redis with version control and recovering after restarts (Implementation Guide §1).
2. **REAL-TIME CRITICAL**: `auction_timer_task` publishes WebSocket timer ticks every ≤15 seconds, and clients display countdowns with drift warning banner when deviation >250ms (Implementation Guide §1).
3. **BUSINESS CRITICAL**: Client timer bloc reconnects, rehydrates via `GET /auctions/{id}/timer`, and reconciles differences using monotonic clock + Datadog drift metrics (Implementation Guide §1).
4. **RELIABILITY CRITICAL**: Timer persistence survives Redis failover scenarios with background reconciliation job ensuring remaining duration accuracy ≤ ±5s across 100 concurrent auctions (Implementation Guide §1 & §5).
5. **OBSERVABILITY CRITICAL**: Datadog metrics `auctions.timer.drift_ms`, `auctions.timer.tick_delay_ms`, and Segment events `auction_timer_started`/`auction_timer_resynced` emit with trace IDs (Monitoring & Analytics).

## Prerequisites
1. Story 01.1 – Bootstrap Repository and Flutter App
2. Story 9.1 – Offer Submission Flow (auction activation event stream)
3. Redis + Serverpod cron infrastructure configured per `docs/architecture/message-queue-architecture.md`
4. Observability baseline (metrics/logging) established using `docs/runbooks/auction-timer.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] End-to-end tests for complete auction lifecycle with timer events

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 9 (Offer Submission) emits `offers.auction.started` events consumed by the scheduler. Align timer registration with Implementation Guide §1 to prevent duplicate entries.

- `Auction` schema provides `starts_at`, `ends_at`, `soft_close_until`, and status for timer orchestration. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Data Models]
- Redis hash `auction:timer:{id}` stores end time, version, policy data for active timers. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]
- `auction_audit_log` records timer registration, tick corrections, and completion entries. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]

- `GET /auctions/{id}/timer` hydrates countdown and includes drift reference timestamp. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]
- `WebSocket /auctions/{id}/updates` streams `TimerTick` payload every 15s with trace context. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]
- `POST /timers/sync` invoked when drift exceed threshold to resynchronize server state. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §4]

- Flutter commerce package owns presentation/BLoC; align file paths with Source Tree directives. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Source Tree]
- Serverpod services (`auction_timer_scheduler.dart`, `auction_timer_task.dart`) manage backend logic for this story. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Source Tree]
- Redis cluster provides timer persistence and reconciliation stream. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]

### File Locations
- Client presentation + BLoCs: `video_window_flutter/packages/features/commerce/lib/presentation/auction_timer/` with tests mirroring under `.../test/presentation/auction_timer/`.
- Feature use cases: `video_window_flutter/packages/features/commerce/lib/use_cases/auction_timer/` coordinating with repositories.
- Core data + WebSocket services: `video_window_flutter/packages/core/lib/data/services/auctions/` and `.../repositories/auctions/` with unit tests in `packages/core/test/`.
- Server-side modules: `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/auctions/` and supporting business logic in `lib/src/business/auctions/`; tests in `video_window_server/test/endpoints/auctions/` and `.../business/`.

- Maintain ≥85% coverage for timer scheduler/task, bloc, and UI components referenced in Test Traceability row for Story 10.1. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Test Traceability]
- Include integration tests simulating tick gaps and verifying drift correction within ±250ms. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Implementation Guide §1]
- Run synthetic timer load tests (100 simultaneous timers) via `melos run test:integration -- --tags auctions-timer`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-10.md – Monitoring & Analytics]

### Technical Constraints
- Timer precision must be maintained within ±5 seconds under normal load with server time synchronization and client drift correction. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#timer-precision-considerations]
- Soft-close extensions must be limited to 15-minute increments with a maximum 24-hour total extension cap from original end time. [Source: brief.md#soft-close-auction-mechanics]
- WebSocket connections must support 1000+ concurrent participants with <100ms latency for timer updates and bid notifications. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#real-time-updates]
- Redis timer state must persist across service restarts with automatic recovery and conflict resolution using version control. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#redis-timer-state-management]
- All timer events and state transitions must be logged to the audit table with complete context for compliance and debugging. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#auction-audit-log-table]
- Error handling must provide graceful degradation when Redis or WebSocket services are unavailable, with fallback polling mechanisms. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#error-handling]

### Project Structure Notes
- Timer implementation aligns with the melos-managed commerce package while keeping networking and repositories in `packages/core/`. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#source-tree]
- WebSocket integration follows established patterns for real-time communication with connection pooling and recovery mechanisms. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#websocket-infrastructure]

### Scope Notes
- Separate initial delivery (Timer Service + Client Countdown) from subsequent enhancements (Soft-Close Extensions, Analytics, SLA Monitoring) to manage complexity and release iteratively.

## Testing
- Follow the project testing pipeline by running `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test --no-pub`, and `dart test` before submission. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Add comprehensive timer BLoC tests with fixtures covering timer precision, soft-close extensions, state transitions, and WebSocket communication scenarios. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
- Implement performance tests validating timer accuracy under load, WebSocket scalability, and Redis persistence reliability. [Source: tech-spec-epic-10.md#performance-tests]
