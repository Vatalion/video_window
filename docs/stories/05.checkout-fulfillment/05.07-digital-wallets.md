# Digital Wallet Integration MVP

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Checkout & Fulfillment

## Story
As a mobile shopper,
I want to pay using Apple Pay or Google Pay with one-tap checkout,
so that I can complete my purchase quickly and securely during live shopping events.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Mobile checkout abandonment is high due to cumbersome payment entry during live shopping events
- **Solution**: Implement one-tap digital wallet payments for the most widely used mobile payment methods
- **Impact**: 28% increase in conversion rates, 35% reduction in cart abandonment during live streams

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Wallet Integration
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user with Apple Pay or Google Pay setup, **When** I reach the payment step during checkout, **Then** I see Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options with 99% accuracy and proper brand styling
- [ ] **Given** I select Apple Pay or Google Pay, **When** I authenticate with biometrics, **Then** my payment is processed in under 2.5 seconds with 99.5% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I complete a wallet payment, **When** the transaction is successful, **Then** I receive a confirmation notification within 1.5 seconds with transaction details
- [ ] **Given** my wallet payment fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** I see a specific error message (insufficient funds, expired card, network issue) and fallback payment option within 2 seconds

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator, **When** a viewer completes a wallet purchase during my live stream, **Then** I see a real-time purchase notification with social proof including buyer avatar and product details within 1 second
- [ ] **Given** I complete a wallet purchase, **When** the transaction is successful, **Then** I can share my purchase to my social feed with one tap with 95% accuracy and auto-generated product images
- [ ] **Given** I use wallet payment, **When** I complete the purchase, **Then** I earn loyalty points that are displayed in my profile with social badges within 3 seconds
- [ ] **Given** I am in a live shopping event, **When** I complete a wallet purchase, **Then** other viewers see a purchase notification that encourages similar purchases with 15% conversion lift
- [ ] **Given** I want to support a creator, **When** I use wallet payment during their live stream, **Then** I can add a tip or bonus (5-25%) with my purchase that benefits the creator directly

### Mobile Experience & Performance
- [ ] **Given** I am using a mobile device, **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the payment sheet appears in under 500ms with native UI components
- [ ] **Given** I have poor network connectivity, **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the system maintains session state and completes payment when connectivity is restored with 98% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I switch between apps during checkout, **When** I return to the app, **Then** my wallet payment session is preserved with all cart items intact
- [ ] **Given** I use wallet payment, **When** the transaction processes, **Then** battery consumption is optimized to use less than 2% of battery for the entire payment flow

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Given** I am using Apple Pay, **When** I authenticate, **Then** the system uses Device Account Numbers (DAN) instead of actual card numbers with 100% compliance
- [ ] **Given** I am using Google Pay, **When** I authenticate, **Then** the system uses virtual payment credentials with end-to-end encryption
- [ ] **Given** my biometric authentication fails, **When** I retry, **Then** the system allows alternative authentication methods after 3 failed attempts
- [ ] **Given** I make a high-value transaction (>$500), **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the system requires additional verification with step-up authentication

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 25% increase in checkout conversion rate for mobile users, 15% increase in average order value from live shopping events, 20% increase in creator tip revenue
- **Technical Metric**: 99.5% wallet payment success rate, sub-2.5 second processing time, 99.95% uptime during peak shopping events, 99.9% token encryption compliance

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization (network, authentication, payment failures) with automated retry logic and graceful degradation
- **Network Resilience**: Offline payment queuing with automatic retry on connectivity restoration, exponential backoff for failed attempts
- **Battery Optimization**: Background processing optimization with minimal wake locks, efficient network polling, and hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Biometric Integration**: Face ID/Touch ID for iOS, fingerprint/face unlock for Android with fallback to device PIN
