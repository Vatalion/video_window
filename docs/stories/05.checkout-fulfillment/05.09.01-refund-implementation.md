# Refund Implementation - Technical Architecture

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Checkout & Fulfillment

## Story
As a Flutter developer implementing the Video Window refund system,
I want to build a comprehensive, mobile-first refund processing architecture with social commerce integration,
so that I can deliver a secure, performant experience that protects creators while transforming refund situations into community-building opportunities.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Current refund implementations are transactional and disconnected, missing opportunities to leverage Video Window's social features for customer retention and creator protection.
- **Solution**: Mobile-first Flutter implementation with integrated communication, fraud detection, and community features that make refund management part of the social commerce experience.
- **Impact**: Enables 30% conversion of refund requests to alternative solutions while maintaining 99.9% payment processing security and 95% fraud detection accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **Performance & User Experience**
- [ ] **Given** a developer implements the refund interface, **When** they build the mobile UI components, **Then** all screens load within 2 seconds on mid-range mobile devices with smooth 60fps animations | *Verification: Performance testing with DevTools*
- [ ] **Given** the refund system needs to handle concurrent users, **When** 1,000+ users access refund management simultaneously, **Then** the system maintains sub-500ms response times with 99.9% uptime | *Verification: Load testing with simulated traffic*
- [ ] **Given** mobile network variability, **When** users access refund features on 3G networks, **Then** core refund operations complete within 3 seconds with appropriate loading states | *Verification: Network throttling tests*

### **Social Commerce Integration**
- [ ] **Given** the refund system needs social integration, **When** a refund request is created, **Then** it automatically suggests relevant creator communication templates with 85% match accuracy | *Verification: Template matching algorithm testing*
- [ ] **Given** creator engagement is important, **When** a refund is resolved, **Then** the system prompts for community feedback with 40% response rate to improve the process | *Verification: A/B testing of feedback prompts*
- [ ] **Given** the system needs social proof integration, **When** a positive refund resolution occurs, **Then** both parties receive community resolution badges that display on their profiles and encourage future transactions | *Verification: Badge system integration testing*
- [ ] **Given** live streaming integration is needed, **When** a creator resolves a refund positively during a live stream, **Then** viewers see a resolution notification that builds trust and increases purchase likelihood by 15% | *Verification: Live stream event simulation*

### **Security & Fraud Detection**
- [ ] **Given** fraud detection is required, **When** a refund request is analyzed, **Then** the system provides risk assessment within 500ms using Stripe Radar with custom Video Window rules | *Verification: Fraud detection API response time monitoring*
- [ ] **Given** biometric security is needed, **When** approving refunds over $100, **Then** the system requires Face ID/Touch ID verification with 98% success rate | *Verification: Biometric authentication testing on iOS/Android*
- [ ] **Given** data protection requirements, **When** refund data is stored or transmitted, **Then** all sensitive information is encrypted with AES-256 and compliant with PCI DSS standards | *Verification: Security audit and penetration testing*

### **Real-time Communication & Notifications**
- [ ] **Given** push notifications are needed, **When** a refund status changes, **Then** relevant users receive notifications within 1 second with 99% delivery rate on both iOS and Android | *Verification: Push notification delivery rate monitoring*
- [ ] **Given** real-time communication needs, **When** creator and buyer communicate about a refund, **Then** messages are delivered within 200ms with read receipts and typing indicators | *Verification: WebSocket latency testing*

### **Offline Capability & Data Sync**
- [ ] **Given** offline capability is required, **When** a user has no internet connection, **Then** they can still view refund history and draft responses with automatic sync when connection restores | *Verification: Offline mode testing with network interruption*
- [ ] **Given** data consistency requirements, **When** multiple devices access refund data, **Then** all devices show synchronized refund status within 2 seconds of updates | *Verification: Cross-device sync testing*

### **Edge Cases & Error Handling**
- [ ] **Given** network failures during refund processing, **When** a connection is lost mid-transaction, **Then** the system automatically resumes and completes the refund when connection restores | *Verification: Network failure simulation testing*
- [ ] **Given** concurrent refund requests for the same order, **When** multiple refund attempts occur simultaneously, **Then** the system prevents duplicate refunds and maintains data integrity | *Verification: Concurrency testing with race conditions*
- [ ] **Given** payment processor failures, **When** Stripe returns an error during refund processing, **Then** the system gracefully handles failures with appropriate retry logic and user notifications | *Verification: Payment processor error simulation*
