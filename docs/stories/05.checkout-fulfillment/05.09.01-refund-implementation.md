# Strategic Context
This implementation supports Video Window's **craft-commerce-first approach** to refunds and cancellations, directly addressing the unique challenges of handmade and custom goods marketplaces.

## Craft-Specific Business Requirements

- **Conversion Uplift**: 15% increase in buyer confidence leading to more purchases
- **Fraud Reduction**: 40% decrease in fraudulent refund attempts
