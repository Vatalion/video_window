## Story
As a social commerce shopper,
I want an interactive address and shipping experience that leverages AI-powered map selection, community delivery networks, and real-time social proof,
so that I can discover local creator hubs, choose convenient pickup locations, and complete purchases with confidence during high-intensity live commerce events.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional address forms create checkout abandonment and miss critical opportunities for local commerce engagement and community building
- **Solution**: AI-enhanced map interface with intelligent auto-fill, community delivery options, and social commerce integration that reduces friction while increasing local discovery
- **Impact**: 40% reduction in address completion time, 25% adoption of community delivery options, and 20% increase in local creator engagement

## Acceptance Criteria
