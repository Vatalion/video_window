# Refund Request & Cancellation Management

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Checkout & Fulfillment

## Story
As a craft creator on Video Window,
I want to initiate and manage refund requests and order cancellations through a mobile-first, socially connected interface,
so that I can protect my business from fraud, maintain customer relationships, turn refund situations into retention opportunities, and focus on creating rather than dispute management.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional marketplaces leave creators vulnerable to refund fraud (70% have experienced it) and provide no tools for customer relationship recovery during refund situations.
- **Solution**: Mobile-first refund management with creator-buyer direct communication, fraud protection, and retention-focused workflows that transform refund requests into loyalty opportunities.
- **Impact**: Reduces refund fraud by 40%, increases creator retention by 25%, and converts 30% of refund requests into alternative solutions through save-the-sale flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Refund Processing
- [ ] **Given** a craft creator has received a refund request, **When** they access the refund management interface, **Then** they can view all refund details including customer profile, order history, and communication history within 2 seconds of page load with 99.9% uptime
- [ ] **Given** a refund request is initiated, **When** the system analyzes the request pattern, **Then** it provides a fraud risk score (low/medium/high) with 95% accuracy within 1 second using Stripe Radar integration
- [ ] **Given** a refund is processed, **When** the transaction completes, **Then** both creator and buyer receive push notifications with status updates and next steps within 30 seconds with 99% delivery reliability

### Communication & Alternative Solutions
- [ ] **Given** a creator wants to address a refund request, **When** they initiate communication with the buyer, **Then** they can send direct messages, video calls, or offers through the app with 95% delivery reliability and message read receipts
- [ ] **Given** a buyer requests a refund for a custom item, **When** the creator responds with alternative solutions, **Then** they can offer store credit (with 10-25% bonus value), repair services, or replacement items with automatic discount application
- [ ] **Given** a refund dispute is resolved positively, **When** the creator and buyer reach an alternative solution, **Then** both parties receive a community resolution badge that builds trust and increases future purchase likelihood by 15%

### Mobile & Security Features
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile creator, **When** I manage refunds on the go, **Then** I can use biometric authentication for high-value refund approvals (over $100) with 98% success rate and handle communications offline with automatic sync
- [ ] **Given** network connectivity is unstable, **When** a creator is processing a refund, **Then** the system maintains data consistency with conflict resolution and provides clear offline/online status indicators
- [ ] **Given** security concerns, **When** accessing sensitive refund information, **Then** the system requires biometric verification and encrypts all data at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption

### Cancellation Management
- [ ] **Given** a cancellation request for a custom order, **When** the creator reviews the request, **Then** they can see the production stage and offer partial cancellation options based on work completed with real-time cost calculations
- [ ] **Given** a creator needs to cancel an order, **When** they initiate cancellation, **Then** the system automatically calculates refund amounts based on production stage, materials used, and time invested with 99% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** a cancellation is processed, **When** the inventory needs to be updated, **Then** the system automatically restores stock levels and updates the order status across all relevant systems within 5 seconds

### Fraud Prevention & Risk Management
- [ ] **Given** suspicious refund patterns are detected, **When** the system flags a request, **Then** it provides detailed risk indicators including purchase history, device fingerprinting, and behavioral analysis with 90% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** high-value refund requests (over $500), **When** they are submitted, **Then** the system requires additional verification steps including ID verification and manual review with 24-hour SLA
- [ ] **Given** potential fraud is detected, **When** a refund is escalated, **Then** the system automatically freezes related transactions and notifies security team within 5 minutes

### Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] **Given** a creator wants to analyze refund trends, **When** they access the refund dashboard, **Then** they can view comprehensive analytics including refund rates, reasons, and resolution outcomes with data export capabilities
- [ ] **Given** business intelligence needs, **When** refund data is aggregated, **Then** the system provides real-time insights on fraud patterns, customer satisfaction, and revenue impact with customizable reporting
