# Digital Wallet Implementation for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Checkout & Fulfillment

## Story
As a mobile social commerce shopper,
I want to use Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal with one-tap checkout during live shopping events,
so that I can complete purchases instantly, participate in group buying, send gifts, and share purchases with my community while maintaining security and convenience.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Mobile checkout abandonment during live shopping events due to cumbersome payment entry, with industry averages showing 70% cart abandonment on mobile
- **Solution**: Implement one-tap digital wallet payments with social commerce features optimized for live shopping interactions
- **Impact**: 35% increase in conversion rates, 40% reduction in cart abandonment during live streams, 25% higher average order value from social features

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Wallet Integration & Performance
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user with Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal setup, **When** I reach the payment step during checkout, **Then** I see wallet payment options with proper brand styling and 99.9% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** I select a digital wallet, **When** I authenticate with biometrics, **Then** my payment is processed in under 2.5 seconds with 99.5% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I complete a wallet payment, **When** the transaction is successful, **Then** I receive a confirmation notification within 1.5 seconds with complete transaction details
- [ ] **Given** my wallet payment fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** I see a specific, contextual error message (insufficient funds, expired card, network issue, authentication failed) and can retry with alternative payment methods within 2 seconds

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** I am watching a live stream, **When** I complete a wallet purchase, **Then** I can send the product as a gift to a friend with personalized message and gift wrapping options
- [ ] **Given** I am in a live shopping event, **When** I initiate a group purchase, **Then** I can invite up to 5 friends to split the cost with real-time progress tracking and automatic payment collection
- [ ] **Given** I complete a wallet purchase, **When** the transaction is successful, **Then** I can share my purchase to my social feed with auto-generated product images and purchase details with 95% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator, **When** a viewer completes a wallet purchase during my live stream, **Then** I receive a real-time notification with social proof (buyer avatar, product details) that I can display on stream within 1 second
- [ ] **Given** I want to support a creator, **When** I use wallet payment during their live stream, **Then** I can add a tip or bonus (5-25%) with my purchase that benefits the creator directly
- [ ] **Given** I make a social purchase, **When** the transaction completes, **Then** I earn community badges and loyalty points that are visible to my followers and unlock exclusive content

### Mobile Experience & Performance
- [ ] **Given** I am using a mobile device, **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the payment sheet appears in under 500ms with native UI components and platform-specific styling
- [ ] **Given** I have poor network connectivity, **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the system maintains session state and completes payment when connectivity is restored with 98% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I switch between apps during checkout, **When** I return to the app, **Then** my wallet payment session is preserved with all cart items intact for up to 30 minutes
- [ ] **Given** I use wallet payment, **When** the transaction processes, **Then** battery consumption is optimized to use less than 2% of battery for the entire payment flow

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Given** I am using Apple Pay, **When** I authenticate, **Then** the system uses Device Account Numbers (DAN) instead of actual card numbers with 100% compliance
- [ ] **Given** I am using Google Pay, **When** I authenticate, **Then** the system uses virtual payment credentials with end-to-end encryption
- [ ] **Given** I am using PayPal, **When** I authenticate, **Then** the system uses OAuth 2.0 with secure token management
- [ ] **Given** my biometric authentication fails, **When** I retry, **Then** the system allows alternative authentication methods after 3 failed attempts
- [ ] **Given** I make a high-value transaction (>$500), **When** I initiate wallet payment, **Then** the system requires additional verification with step-up authentication

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 35% increase in checkout conversion rates for mobile users, 25% increase in average order value from live shopping events, 20% increase in creator tip revenue
- **Technical Metric**: 99.5% wallet payment success rate, sub-2.5 second processing time, 99.95% uptime during peak shopping events, 99.9% token encryption compliance
