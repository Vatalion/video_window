# Status
**Status:** Draft

# Story
**As a** craft creator,
**I want** a comprehensive media management system for video compression, image editing, and library organization,
**so that** I can efficiently manage and optimize all media assets for my craft stories.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Video compression and optimization for mobile viewing
2. Image editing and enhancement tools (cropping, filters, adjustments)
3. Thumbnail generation and selection for video and image assets
4. Media library with organization features (folders, tags, search)
5. Bulk upload capabilities for multiple media files
6. Media format validation and conversion tools
7. Media usage analytics and performance tracking
8. Version control and backup for media assets

# Dev Notes
## Technical Requirements
- Use Flutter's image manipulation libraries for image editing
- Implement video processing with FFmpeg integration
- Create custom media storage and caching system
- Use SQLite or local storage for media library metadata
- Implement file system access and management
- Build background processing queue for media operations

## Integration Points
- Video capture system for imported recordings
- Timeline creation tools for media asset usage
- User authentication for media library access
- Cloud storage service for backup and synchronization
- Analytics service for media usage tracking
- Content management system for published media

## Testing Requirements
- Test video compression quality and performance
- Validate image editing functionality and filters
- Test thumbnail generation accuracy and performance
- Validate media library search and organization
- Test bulk upload reliability and error handling
- Validate version control and backup functionality

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize video compression processing time
- Implement efficient image editing with hardware acceleration
- Minimize memory usage for large media libraries
- Ensure responsive media library browsing
- Optimize thumbnail generation for quick preview
- Implement background processing for heavy operations
