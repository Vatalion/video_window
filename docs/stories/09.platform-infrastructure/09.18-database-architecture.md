# Database Design and Architecture Implementation

## 1. Title
Comprehensive Database Design and Architecture Implementation for Data Foundation

## 2. Context
**Background**: The application requires a solid foundation for data storage, integrity, and performance optimization. Building upon the existing Serverpod on AWS architecture with RDS, this database design must support core entities including users, creators, stories, products, and services while maintaining privacy requirements and event capture capabilities.

**Motivation**: A well-designed database architecture is critical for application performance, scalability, and data integrity. This story establishes the foundational data layer that all other components will depend upon, ensuring proper relationship modeling, optimization strategies, and security measures are in place from the start.

**Business Value**: Reduces technical debt, improves query performance by 40-60%, ensures data consistency across the application, and provides scalability for future growth while maintaining compliance with privacy requirements.

## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validated Process:**

### Development Workflow
1. **Schema Design Phase**: Create entity-relationship diagrams and table definitions

4. **Performance Testing**: Run query performance benchmarks and optimization
5. **Security Validation**: Test access controls and encryption mechanisms
6. **Documentation**: Complete all technical documentation
7. **QA Testing**: Execute comprehensive test suite including load testing

### Naming Conventions
- **Table Names**: snake_case, plural (e.g., `users`, `creator_profiles`)
- **Column Names**: snake_case, descriptive (e.g., `created_at`, `is_active`)
- **Index Names**: `idx_table_columns` pattern
- **Constraint Names**: `fk_table_column_reference` for foreign keys
- **Migration Files**: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`

### Code Quality Standards
- All migrations must include rollback scripts
- Database models must include comprehensive validation
- Queries must use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling must be properly configured for production loads
- Error handling must be comprehensive and user-friendly

### Integration Rules
- Database changes must not break existing API contracts
- Schema changes must be backward compatible where possible
- Performance must be validated before deployment
- Security must be reviewed and approved before production deployment
