# File Storage and Management System

## 1. Title
Comprehensive File Storage and Management System with Media Processing and CDN Integration

## 2. Context
**Background**: The application needs to efficiently handle media files, documents, and other digital assets with proper optimization, security, and scalability. Building upon the database architecture from Story 9.1, this system must integrate with existing AWS infrastructure while maintaining privacy requirements and supporting various file types including videos, images, documents, and audio.

**Motivation**: A robust file storage system is critical for user experience, performance, and scalability. Users expect fast upload/download speeds, reliable media processing, and secure access to their files. This system must handle large volumes of media content while optimizing costs and ensuring data integrity.

**Business Value**: Improves user satisfaction with fast content delivery, reduces storage costs through intelligent optimization, enables content creators to upload and manage media efficiently, and ensures compliance with data privacy regulations while providing scalable infrastructure for future growth.

### Naming Conventions
- **Service Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `S3StorageService`)
- **Storage Buckets**: Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `app-media-files`)
- **File Paths**: Use consistent folder structure by type and user
- **Configuration Files**: snake_case.yaml (e.g., `storage_config.yaml`)
- **Processing Jobs**: descriptive names with timestamps

### Code Quality Standards
- All storage operations must include proper error handling
- File uploads must use chunked transfers for large files
- Security must be implemented at both application and infrastructure levels
- Performance metrics must be tracked and monitored
- All file operations must be idempotent where possible

### Integration Rules
- Storage interfaces must be well-defined and abstracted
- API contracts must be maintained for frontend integration
- Database schema from Story 9.1 must be used for metadata
- Performance requirements must be validated before deployment
- Security must be reviewed and approved before production deployment
