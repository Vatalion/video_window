# Story: Sandbox Environment

## 1. Title
Create isolated sandbox environment for safe API testing, experimentation, and validation without affecting production systems.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:**
A sandbox environment is essential for developer productivity and testing. It provides an isolated space where developers can test API calls, experiment with different scenarios, and validate their integrations before deploying to production. This story exists to ensure developers have a safe, realistic testing environment that mirrors production without risk to live data or systems.

**PO Validation:** Sandbox environment is critical for developer confidence and preventing production issues.

## 3. Requirements
**Explicit Requirements (Validated by PO):**
- Create isolated sandbox infrastructure separate from production
- Generate realistic test data sets for comprehensive testing
- Implement API simulation and mocking for various scenarios
- Set up sandbox-specific authentication and API keys
- Create developer-friendly dashboard for environment management
- Implement automated data refresh and reset mechanisms
- Set up usage monitoring and resource utilization tracking
- Create automated environment maintenance and health checks
- Ensure sandbox performance meets development needs

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- Implement proper isolation between environments
- Support realistic but anonymized test data
- Provide API behavior customization options
- Implement proper security measures for sandbox access

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
