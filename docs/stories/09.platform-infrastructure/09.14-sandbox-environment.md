## Story
As a **developer or integration partner**, I want **self-service access to an instantly resettable sandbox environment with realistic viral commerce scenarios and comprehensive analytics**, so that **I can safely test integrations, simulate realistic commerce flows, and measure my implementation success before going to production**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Partner Self-Service Portal**: Developers can create, configure, and manage sandbox environments through a self-service portal with <5 minute setup time and 95% success rate. Verification: Automated usability testing with 50+ developers, track setup completion rates and time-to-first-API-call.

2. **Instant Environment Reset**: Partners can reset their sandbox environment to a clean state in <30 seconds with 99.9% reliability, preserving their custom configurations while clearing all transactional data. Verification: Load testing with 100 concurrent reset operations, measure response times and success rates.

3. **Realistic Viral Commerce Scenarios**: Sandbox includes 10+ pre-seeded datasets simulating viral commerce scenarios (peak traffic 10K concurrent users, 100K transactions/hour) with realistic product catalogs, user behaviors, and seasonal patterns. Verification: Scenario validation testing, measure data realism score and scenario coverage.

4. **Safe Payment Token Testing**: Sandbox provides complete payment token testing with 100% safe test tokens that mirror production behavior but never process real transactions, including all major payment methods (cards, digital wallets, BNPL). Verification: Payment gateway integration testing, verify token safety and behavior parity.

5. **Partner Success Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard tracks partner usage patterns, success metrics, and implementation health with 99% data accuracy and <1 minute latency for critical metrics. Verification: Analytics validation testing, measure data accuracy and dashboard performance.

6. **Production Parity**: Sandbox API behavior matches production with 99.9% compatibility, including rate limits, error responses, and performance characteristics within 10% variance. Verification: API compatibility testing suite, measure behavior parity percentage.

7. **Resource Efficiency**: Sandbox environments auto-scale based on usage patterns with 95% resource efficiency, maintaining performance while optimizing costs (max $50/month per active partner). Verification: Resource monitoring, track scaling efficiency and cost per partner.

8. **Security Isolation**: Complete isolation from production systems with 100% data separation, preventing any possibility of data leakage or cross-environment contamination. Verification: Security penetration testing, verify isolation effectiveness.

9. **Developer Experience**: Developer satisfaction score of 4.5/5 or higher, measured through quarterly surveys, with comprehensive documentation and responsive support (24-hour response time). Verification: Developer satisfaction surveys and support ticket analysis.

10. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Real-time monitoring with 99.9% uptime, automated alerting for environment issues, and predictive health scoring with 95% accuracy for potential problems. Verification: System reliability testing, measure uptime and alert accuracy.

## Technical Requirements
