# API Rate Limiting for Social Commerce Platform

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Platform Infrastructure Foundation

## Story
As a **Mobile Commerce Creator**, I want **an intelligent API rate limiting system that adapts to social commerce patterns**, so that **I can ensure fair access to platform resources during peak shopping events, protect against abuse while maintaining community engagement, and provide transparent usage guidance to my followers and customers.**

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional rate limiting systems don't account for social commerce traffic patterns, leading to unfair throttling during live shopping events and poor user experience for community interactions.
- **Solution**: Implement adaptive rate limiting with social commerce awareness, tiered access for creators, and mobile-optimized enforcement.
- **Impact**: 40% reduction in API abuse, 25% improvement in live commerce reliability, and 30% higher user satisfaction during peak shopping events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator hosting a live shopping event, **when** my community engages with products, **then** I experience adaptive rate limiting that prioritizes commerce interactions over general browsing, maintaining 99.9% uptime for critical shopping features.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user browsing social shopping feeds, **when** I encounter rate limits, **then** I receive helpful mobile-optimized guidance with retry recommendations, achieving 85% user satisfaction with limit notifications.
- [ ] **Given** I am a platform administrator, **when** I monitor rate limiting during commerce events, **then** I see intelligent tier-based enforcement with 40% reduction in abuse while maintaining 95% availability for legitimate commerce activities.
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator with different subscription tiers, **when** my APIs are rate limited, **then** I experience fair allocation based on my creator tier and community size, with 50% higher limits for premium creators.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile developer integrating APIs, **when** I implement rate limiting handling, **then** I have access to Flutter-specific SDK features and best practices, reducing integration time by 60%.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 25% increase in successful commerce transactions during peak events through fair rate limiting
- **Technical Metric**: <5ms rate limiting processing overhead with 99.95% accuracy in threat detection
- **User Metric**: 30% improvement in user satisfaction during high-traffic shopping events

## Technical Requirements
- **Flutter Integration**: Implement rate limiting SDK for Flutter apps with offline-first capabilities, local caching, and biometric-aware limit management
- **Social Commerce Awareness**: Design adaptive algorithms that recognize shopping events, community engagement patterns, and creator-tier relationships
- **Mobile Optimization**: Create battery-efficient rate limiting with intelligent caching, network-aware enforcement, and background request management
- **Tier-based System**: Implement creator and user tier classifications with dynamic limit adjustments based on commerce activity and community impact
- **Performance Targets**: <5ms processing overhead, 99.95% uptime, support for 1M concurrent mobile users

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Flutter HTTP clients, Redis caching, mobile network detection libraries, biometric authentication packages
- **Business**: Creator monetization strategies, community management policies, peak shopping event schedules
- **Prerequisites**: User authentication system, creator tier management, mobile app architecture

## Out of Scope
- Complex machine learning-based threat detection
- Third-party rate limiting service integrations
- Advanced billing and usage analytics
- Network-level DDoS protection
