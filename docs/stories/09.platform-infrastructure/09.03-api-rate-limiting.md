# Story: API Rate Limiting System

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive API rate limiting and throttling system with user classification, distributed support, and monitoring capabilities.

## 2. Context
Rate limiting is essential for protecting the API from abuse, preventing DDoS attacks, and ensuring fair resource allocation among all users. As a system administrator, I need to implement API rate limiting and throttling so that I can prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain system stability under high load conditions. This system should be configurable, provide appropriate feedback to developers, and work seamlessly across both REST and GraphQL endpoints while maintaining system performance and reliability.

## 3. Requirements
- **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Define rate limiting rules for different API endpoints with user role-based tiers and burst handling
- **Rate Limiting Middleware**: Create middleware for rate limiting enforcement with Redis-based distributed support and in-memory fallback
- **User Classification**: Implement different rate limits for anonymous vs authenticated users with subscription level tiers
- **Response Headers**: Add rate limiting information to response headers with Retry-After headers and standardized error responses
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Set up rate limiting event logging, dashboards for violations, and suspicious activity alerting
- **Configuration Management**: Create configuration system for rate limit rules with dynamic adjustment and override capabilities
- **Testing and Validation**: Create comprehensive test suite with load testing scenarios and performance monitoring

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Rate limiting is enforced on all API endpoints (REST and GraphQL) with proper middleware integration
- Different rate limits apply based on user authentication status and subscription tiers
- Rate limit information is included in response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- Appropriate HTTP status codes (429) are returned when limits are exceeded with Retry-After headers
- Rate limiting works in distributed environments using Redis with graceful fallback to in-memory
- Configuration changes take effect without service restart through dynamic configuration loading
- Monitoring captures all rate limiting events with detailed analytics and alerting
- Performance impact is minimal (< 5ms per request) under normal load conditions
- Documentation explains rate limiting behavior, configuration options, and integration guidelines

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Algorithm Selection**: Use token bucket or sliding window algorithm for accurate rate limiting
- **Distributed Support**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting for scalability with proper fallback mechanisms
- **Configuration Management**: Use YAML configuration files with environment-specific overrides
- **Error Handling**: Provide graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable without blocking requests
- **Monitoring Integration**: Integrate with existing monitoring systems for comprehensive visibility
- **Testing Strategy**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and load testing scenarios
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures to prevent rate limiting bypass attempts
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for configuration and usage
