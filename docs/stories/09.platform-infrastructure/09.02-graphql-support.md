# GraphQL Support for Social Commerce Platform

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Platform Infrastructure Foundation

## Story
As a **Mobile Commerce Creator**, I want **a GraphQL API optimized for social commerce experiences**, so that **I can efficiently manage complex product catalogs, real-time inventory updates, and community interactions with flexible data fetching that enhances mobile app performance and user engagement.**

## Business Value
- **Problem**: RESTful APIs create over-fetching/under-fetching issues for complex social commerce scenarios, leading to poor mobile performance and inefficient data transfer.
- **Solution**: Implement GraphQL with social commerce-optimized schema, real-time subscriptions, and mobile-first performance optimizations.
- **Impact**: 45% reduction in mobile data usage, 30% improvement in app performance, and 50% faster load times for complex commerce interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile creator using the Flutter app, **when** I query product catalogs with multiple filters and social proof, **then** I receive exactly the data I need in a single request, achieving 60% reduction in payload size and 40% faster load times.
- [ ] **Given** I am a shopper during a live commerce event, **when** I browse products with real-time inventory updates, **then** I see inventory changes instantly through GraphQL subscriptions with <100ms latency and 99.9% accuracy.
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator managing community engagement, **when** I access user comments and reactions, **then** I can fetch nested social data efficiently with 50% fewer API calls, improving mobile battery life by 25%.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user exploring social shopping feeds, **when** I interact with shoppable content, **then** I experience seamless real-time updates for product availability and community interactions, achieving 35% higher engagement rates.
- [ ] **Given** I am a platform administrator, **when** I monitor GraphQL performance, **then** I see 70% improvement in query efficiency and 45% reduction in mobile data costs for social commerce features.
