# Story: GraphQL Support Implementation

## 1. Title
Implement GraphQL server with schema definitions, resolvers, and subscriptions for flexible data querying and real-time updates.

## 2. Context
GraphQL provides a more flexible approach to data fetching, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need. This is particularly valuable for mobile applications and complex data relationships in our video platform. As a backend developer, I need to implement GraphQL support alongside the RESTful API so that clients can efficiently query complex data relationships and reduce over-fetching/under-fetching of data. The implementation must integrate seamlessly with existing authentication and data models while providing the performance benefits GraphQL offers.

## 3. Requirements
- **GraphQL Server Setup**: Install and configure GraphQL server library with proper endpoint configuration
- **Schema Definition**: Define types for all core entities (User, Video, Comments, etc.) with Query and Mutation types
- **Resolver Implementation**: Create resolvers for all query operations and mutation resolvers for data modification
- **Subscription Support**: Implement GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates with WebSocket connections
- **Integration**: Share authentication between REST and GraphQL, use existing data models and business logic
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement query complexity analysis, query depth limiting, and caching
- **Documentation**: Set up GraphQL Playground/IDE, generate schema documentation, and create developer guide

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- GraphQL server is running and accessible at defined endpoint
- All core entities are defined in the schema with proper relationships
- Basic CRUD operations work via GraphQL with proper error handling
- Complex nested queries execute efficiently with appropriate performance (< 500ms)
- Subscriptions work for real-time updates with WebSocket connections
- Query complexity analysis prevents expensive queries and protects system resources
- Authentication works with GraphQL operations using existing auth system
- GraphQL Playground is accessible and functional for testing and development
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date with schema examples
- Integration with existing REST API maintains consistency in responses

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Development Approach**: Use Code-first approach for schema generation to maintain type safety
- **Performance**: Implement DataLoader pattern for efficient data fetching and batch database queries
- **Security**: Apply existing authentication middleware to GraphQL endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling matches REST API standards for consistency
- **Testing**: Test all resolvers, mutations, and subscriptions with comprehensive coverage
- **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring for GraphQL query execution times
- **Documentation**: Keep schema documentation synchronized with implementation changes
- **Versioning**: Implement schema versioning and deprecation policies for field changes
