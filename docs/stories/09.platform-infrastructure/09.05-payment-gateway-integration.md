# Payment Gateway Integration for Social Commerce Platform

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Platform Infrastructure Foundation

## Story
As a **Mobile Commerce Creator**, I want **a seamless payment gateway integration optimized for social commerce**, so that **I can process payments during live shopping events, offer multiple payment options to my community, and maximize conversion rates with mobile-first checkout experiences.**

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional payment systems create friction during social commerce interactions, leading to abandoned carts during live events and poor mobile checkout experiences.
- **Solution**: Implement mobile-optimized payment processing with social commerce features, multiple payment methods, and live shopping integration.
- **Impact**: 40% increase in mobile checkout completion, 25% reduction in cart abandonment during live events, and 35% improvement in creator revenue generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator hosting a live shopping event, **when** my community purchases products, **then** I experience seamless payment processing with <3 second checkout time and 99.9% success rate, even during peak shopping moments.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile shopper during a live commerce session, **when** I checkout with one-tap payment options, **then** I can use Apple Pay, Google Pay, or saved payment methods with biometric authentication, achieving 45% higher conversion rates.
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator managing multiple payment methods, **when** I configure payment options for my audience, **then** I can offer social commerce-optimized payment choices including digital wallets, buy-now-pay-later, and local payment methods, increasing sales by 30%.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user with intermittent connectivity, **when** I process payments during live events, **then** I experience offline-first payment capabilities with local storage and automatic retry logic, maintaining 85% success rate in poor network conditions.
- [ ] **Given** I am a platform administrator, **when** I monitor payment performance, **then** I see 40% improvement in mobile checkout metrics and 25% reduction in payment-related support tickets for social commerce features.
