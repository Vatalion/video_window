# Story: Email Service Integration

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive email service integration with SendGrid and Mailchimp for transactional emails, marketing campaigns, and automated communication workflows.

## 2. Context
Email communication is essential for user engagement, account management, and system notifications. As a backend developer, I need to integrate email services (SendGrid, Mailchimp) so that the application can send transactional emails, marketing communications, and user notifications reliably. The application needs a robust email service that can handle high volume, provide deliverability guarantees, and support various email types including user registration confirmations, password resets, marketing campaigns, and system notifications while maintaining compliance with email regulations and providing comprehensive analytics.

## 3. Requirements
- **Email Service Setup**: Set up SendGrid for transactional emails, configure Mailchimp for marketing campaigns, create email service abstraction layer, set up email template management
- **Transactional Emails**: Implement user registration confirmation emails, create password reset functionality, set up account notification emails, implement email verification workflows
- **Email Templates**: Create responsive email templates, implement dynamic content insertion, set up template versioning and management, create email localization support
- **Email Delivery Management**: Implement email queue and retry logic, set up bounce and complaint handling, create email delivery tracking, implement email analytics integration
- **Marketing Integration**: Set up Mailchimp campaign management, implement user segmentation, create automated email sequences, set up marketing analytics
- **Security and Compliance**: Implement email list management, set up unsubscribe functionality, create CAN-SPAM compliance measures, implement email content filtering
- **Testing and Monitoring**: Create email delivery testing tools, set up email deliverability monitoring, implement email performance analytics, create email failure alerting

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- SendGrid integration is functional for transactional emails with proper deliverability
- Mailchimp integration works for marketing campaigns with user segmentation
- Email templates render correctly across email clients and devices
- Email delivery queue handles high volume reliably with proper retry logic
- Bounce and complaint processing works automatically with list management
- Unsubscribe functionality is compliant with regulations and easy to use
- Email analytics provide useful insights for optimization
- Performance monitoring detects delivery issues and provides alerts
- All email flows work in development and production environments

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Deliverability**: Follow email deliverability best practices and maintain sender reputation
- **Template Design**: Use responsive design principles for email templates
- **Compliance**: Adhere to CAN-SPAM and GDPR regulations for email communications
- **Testing**: Test email templates across various email clients and devices
- **Monitoring**: Monitor email deliverability rates and bounce handling
- **Performance**: Optimize email sending performance and queue management
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for email content and user data
- **Analytics**: Track email performance metrics and user engagement
