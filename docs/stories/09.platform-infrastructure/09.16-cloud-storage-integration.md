# Story: Cloud Storage Integration

## 1. Title
Integrate AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2 cloud storage services for efficient media file management and delivery.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:**
Cloud storage is essential for handling large media files, providing scalability, reliability, and global content delivery. The application needs a robust storage solution that can handle video uploads, user avatars, thumbnails, and other media assets. This story exists to implement a reliable, scalable storage infrastructure that supports the video window application's media requirements.

**PO Validation:** Cloud storage integration is critical for application performance, scalability, and user experience with media content.

## 3. Requirements
**Explicit Requirements (Validated by PO):**
- Integrate AWS S3 as primary storage provider
- Configure Cloudflare R2 as backup/storage alternative
- Implement secure file upload and download capabilities
- Create efficient file organization and folder structure
- Set up file versioning and backup mechanisms
- Implement CDN integration for fast content delivery
- Create storage usage monitoring and cost optimization tools
- Set up automated backup and recovery procedures
- Ensure high performance for large file transfers

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use official cloud provider SDKs (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2)
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Support efficient file transfer protocols
- Follow security best practices for file access
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
