# API Authentication for Social Commerce Platform

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Platform Infrastructure Foundation

## Story
As a **Mobile Commerce Creator**, I want **a secure yet frictionless authentication system optimized for social commerce**, so that **I can seamlessly engage with my community, process payments, and manage my commerce activities across mobile devices while ensuring user data privacy and security.**

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional authentication systems create friction for social commerce interactions, leading to abandoned shopping carts and poor user engagement during live events.
- **Solution**: Implement mobile-first authentication with biometric support, social login integration, and context-aware security for social commerce scenarios.
- **Impact**: 35% reduction in authentication friction, 40% improvement in checkout completion rates, and 30% increase in user engagement with commerce features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile creator using the Flutter app, **when** I authenticate during a live shopping event, **then** I can use biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID) with <2 second completion time, maintaining 99.9% session security during commerce transactions.
- [ ] **Given** I am a shopper during a live commerce session, **when** I make a purchase, **then** I experience seamless authentication with social login options and one-tap checkout, achieving 45% higher conversion rates and 30% less cart abandonment.
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator managing community engagement, **when** I switch between different commerce activities, **then** I maintain secure sessions across devices with 99.95% uptime and automatic token refresh for continuous engagement.
- [ ] **Given** I am a mobile user on poor network connectivity, **when** I authenticate for commerce features, **then** I experience offline-first authentication capabilities with local biometric validation, achieving 85% success rate even with intermittent connectivity.
- [ ] **Given** I am a platform administrator, **when** I monitor authentication performance, **then** I see 40% reduction in authentication-related support tickets and 35% improvement in user retention for commerce activities.

## Success Metrics
