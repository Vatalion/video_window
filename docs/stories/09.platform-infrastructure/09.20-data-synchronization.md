## 1. Title
Comprehensive Data Synchronization System with Real-time Updates, Offline Capabilities, and Multi-region Replication

## 2. Context
**Background**: The application requires robust data synchronization across all clients and servers with real-time updates, offline capabilities, and conflict resolution. Building upon the database architecture (Story 9.1) and file storage systems (Story 9.2), this synchronization system must handle complex scenarios including concurrent modifications, network partitions, and geographic distribution while maintaining data consistency and privacy requirements.

**Motivation**: Modern users expect seamless real-time collaboration, offline functionality, and instant data synchronization across devices. This system is critical for user experience, data integrity, and application reliability. It must handle edge cases like network failures, concurrent edits, and device synchronization while providing a smooth user experience.

**Business Value**: Enables real-time collaboration features, improves user experience with offline capabilities, ensures data consistency across all devices, provides geographic distribution for global users, reduces data loss risk, and enables advanced features like collaborative editing and instant notifications.
