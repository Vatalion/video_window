# Social Media Authentication System

## 1. Title
Implement social media authentication system for user registration and login using Google, Apple, and Facebook providers.

## 2. Context
This story builds upon the existing user authentication system established in Story 1.1, which implemented email/phone-based registration and JWT authentication. The goal is to provide users with convenient social media login options to reduce friction during onboarding and improve user experience. Social authentication is increasingly expected by users and can significantly increase conversion rates for new user registration.

## 3. Requirements
- Implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication for user registration and login
- Implement Apple Sign In authentication for user registration and login
- Implement Facebook OAuth 2.0 authentication for user registration and login
- Social authentication must create new user accounts or link to existing accounts
- Profile information (name, email, profile picture) must be automatically imported from social accounts
- Users must be able to link multiple social accounts to a single user profile
- Social authentication must work alongside existing email/phone registration methods
- Implement comprehensive error handling for failed social authentication attempts
- Users must be able to unlink social accounts from their profile
- All social authentication must comply with respective platform policies and OAuth 2.0 security standards
- Social tokens must be securely stored using platform-specific secure storage (iOS Keychain)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. **Google OAuth Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Google OAuth and create/access their account
2. **Apple Sign In Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Apple Sign In and create/access their account
3. **Facebook OAuth Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Facebook OAuth and create/access their account
4. **Account Creation/Linking**: Social authentication properly creates new accounts or links to existing user accounts
5. **Profile Data Import**: User profile information (name, email, profile picture) is automatically imported and saved from social accounts
6. **Multi-Account Linking**: Users can link multiple social accounts to a single user profile
7. **Coexistence with Email/Phone**: Social authentication works alongside existing email/phone registration without conflicts
8. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling provides clear feedback for failed social authentication attempts
9. **Account Unlinking**: Users can successfully unlink social accounts from their profile
10. **Platform Compliance**: All social authentication implementations comply with respective platform policies and security standards
