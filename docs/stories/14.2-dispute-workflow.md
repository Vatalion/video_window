## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

   - Add internal notes (not visible to users)

3. **Resolution Options**
   - Full refund (with/without return)
   - Partial refund
   - No refund (reject dispute)
   - Seller replacement offer
   
4. **Communication**
   - In-app messaging between buyer/seller/admin
   - Email notifications for status changes
   - 48-hour response window for each party

### Technical Requirements
1. Database: `dispute_timeline` table for audit trail
2. State machine implementation with validation rules
3. SLA monitoring with background jobs
4. Admin portal integration (Flutter Web)

### UI/UX Requirements
1. Admin dashboard: List view with filters (status, SLA breach)
2. Dispute detail page with evidence gallery
3. Action buttons based on current state
4. Timeline visualization

## Technical Notes

### State Machine
```dart
enum DisputeStatus {
  pending,       // Initial state
  investigating, // Admin reviewing
  resolved,      // Resolution accepted
  escalated,     // Needs higher-level review
  rejected       // Dispute denied
}

Map<DisputeStatus, List<DisputeStatus>> allowedTransitions = {
  DisputeStatus.pending: [DisputeStatus.investigating, DisputeStatus.rejected],
  DisputeStatus.investigating: [DisputeStatus.resolved, DisputeStatus.escalated],
  DisputeStatus.escalated: [DisputeStatus.resolved, DisputeStatus.rejected],
};
```

### Database Schema
```sql
dispute_timeline(
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  dispute_id UUID REFERENCES disputes(id),
  actor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  action VARCHAR(50),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```
