# 1. Title
Abandoned Cart Recovery System

**Status: IN_DEV**

# 2. Context
This story addresses the critical business problem of cart abandonment in e-commerce, where customers add items to their cart but leave without completing the purchase. The abandoned cart recovery system aims to automate the process of re-engaging customers who have abandoned their shopping carts through targeted, personalized campaigns across multiple communication channels. This is essential for maximizing conversion rates and recovering potentially lost revenue from customers who have shown clear purchase intent.

# 3. Requirements
**Explicit requirements validated by PO:**
- Automated detection of abandoned carts based on configurable time thresholds
- Multi-channel recovery campaigns (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Personalized recovery message templates with dynamic content insertion
- Configurable campaign scheduling and timing optimization
- A/B testing framework for recovery message strategies
- Incentive system for cart recovery (discounts, special offers)
- Comprehensive recovery analytics and reporting dashboard
- Customer segmentation for targeted outreach based on behavior
- Multi-channel campaign coordination and preference management
- Opt-out management and communication preference controls
- Integration with existing email service providers and SMS gateways
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR/CCPA)

# 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Testable points ensured by QA:**
1. **Abandoned cart detection and tracking** - System identifies carts abandoned after X hours of inactivity
2. **Automated email/SMS recovery campaigns** - Campaigns trigger automatically based on configured rules
3. **Personalized recovery message templates** - Messages include customer name, cart contents, and personalized recommendations
4. **Recovery campaign scheduling and timing** - Campaigns schedule at optimal times based on customer behavior
5. **A/B testing for recovery strategies** - System tests different message variations and tracks performance
6. **Incentive and discount offers for recovery** - Dynamic discount generation based on cart value and customer segment
7. **Recovery analytics and reporting** - Dashboard shows recovery rates, campaign performance, and ROI metrics
8. **Customer segmentation for targeting** - Customers segmented by behavior, value, and demographics
9. **Multi-channel recovery options** - Campaigns coordinate across email, SMS, and push notifications
10. **Opt-out and preference management** - Customers can manage communication preferences and opt-out
