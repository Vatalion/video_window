# Story: Payment Gateway Integration

## 1. Title
Implement secure payment gateway integration with Stripe and PayPal for subscriptions, one-time purchases, and recurring billing with PCI compliance.

## 2. Context
The application requires payment processing capabilities to handle subscriptions, one-time purchases, and recurring billing. As a payment systems engineer, I need to integrate payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) so that users can securely make payments for premium features and subscriptions within the application. This integration must be secure, compliant with payment regulations, and provide a smooth user experience while handling various payment scenarios including refunds, disputes, and subscription management.

## 3. Requirements
- **Payment Gateway Setup**: Set up Stripe integration for credit card processing, configure PayPal for alternative payment methods, create payment gateway abstraction layer
- **Payment Processing**: Implement one-time payment processing, create subscription management system, set up recurring billing handling, implement payment method storage (PCI compliant)
- **Transaction Management**: Create transaction tracking and logging, implement payment confirmation workflows, set up refund and cancellation processing, create payment dispute handling
- **Security and Compliance**: Implement PCI-DSS compliance measures, set up secure tokenization of payment data, create fraud detection and prevention, implement proper error handling
- **User Interface Integration**: Create payment forms and checkout flows, implement payment method management UI, set up subscription management interface, create payment history and receipt generation
- **Webhook Integration**: Set up payment gateway webhooks, implement webhook security validation, create webhook event processing, set up webhook failure handling
- **Testing and Validation**: Create comprehensive payment test suite, set up payment gateway sandbox testing, implement payment flow integration tests, create payment failure scenario testing

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Stripe integration is functional for credit card payments with proper error handling
- PayPal integration works for alternative payment methods with user-friendly interface
- Subscription management handles all lifecycle events (create, update, cancel, renew)
- Payment processing is secure and PCI compliant with proper data protection
- Webhooks process payment events reliably with proper validation and retry logic
- Payment forms provide good user experience with proper validation and feedback
- Error handling covers all payment failure scenarios with appropriate user messages
- Transaction logging is comprehensive and searchable for audit and support purposes
- All payment flows work in both test and production environments with proper configuration

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Security Compliance**: Follow PCI-DSS compliance requirements and payment industry standards
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate user-facing messages
- **Transaction Management**: Maintain detailed transaction logs and audit trails
- **Testing Strategy**: Use sandbox environments for development and testing
- **Monitoring**: Set up payment transaction monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear payment integration documentation
- **Performance**: Optimize payment processing for reliability and speed
- **User Experience**: Design intuitive payment flows with proper feedback
