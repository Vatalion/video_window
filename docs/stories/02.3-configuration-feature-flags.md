# Story 02.3: Implement Configuration and Feature Flag Service

**Epic:** 02 - Core Platform Services  
**Story ID:** 02.3  
**Priority:** P1 - High (Foundation)  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points  
**Status:** Draft

---

## User Story

**As a** release manager,  
**I want** runtime configuration and kill switches,  
**So that** experiments or risky features can be toggled without redeploying.

---

## Business Value

- **Risk Mitigation:** Disable problematic features instantly without app updates
- **A/B Testing:** Enable experiments for specific user segments
- **Gradual Rollout:** Progressive feature enablement to manage risk
- **Operational Flexibility:** Toggle features based on system health or business needs

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Remote Configuration Service**
   - Fetch configuration from Serverpod endpoint on app launch
   - Local fallback configuration if network unavailable
   - Cache remote config with TTL (time-to-live)
   - Support configuration refresh without app restart

2. **Feature Flag System**
   - Strongly-typed feature flag helpers (e.g., `FeatureFlags.auctionEnabled`)
   - Boolean flags with default values
   - User segment targeting (e.g., makers only, beta users)
   - Percentage-based rollout (e.g., 10% of users)

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, production)
   - Version tracking for configuration changes
   - Audit log of configuration updates
   - Admin dashboard for flag management (future)

4. **Testing Support**
   - Override flags in test environment
   - Mock configuration service for unit tests
   - Integration tests validate flag behavior
