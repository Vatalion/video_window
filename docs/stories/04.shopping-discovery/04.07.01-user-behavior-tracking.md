# User Behavior Tracking for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Shopping & Discovery - Personalization

## Story
As a social commerce platform user,
I want my content engagement and shopping behaviors to be tracked accurately and privately,
so that I receive personalized recommendations that improve my discovery of relevant craft content and products.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Manual content discovery is inefficient and users miss relevant craft content and creator products
- **Solution**: Automated behavior tracking that powers personalized recommendations while respecting privacy
- **Impact**: 45% improvement in content discovery efficiency and 25% increase in commerce conversion rates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user views craft content, **when** the interaction occurs, **then** the event is captured with <100ms latency and 99.9% accuracy across all mobile devices, including video view duration, scroll depth, and pause/resume actions
- [ ] **Given** a user engages with creator content (likes, comments, shares, saves), **when** the action is performed, **then** social engagement signals are tracked and processed within 200ms with 99.5% accuracy for recommendation algorithm training
- [ ] **Given** a user browses or purchases products, **when** commerce interactions occur, **then** purchase intent signals are captured with 95% accuracy including product views, cart additions, wishlist actions, and checkout completion
- [ ] **Given** privacy requirements, **when** data is collected, **then** all tracking complies with GDPR/CCPA with explicit granular consent management, data anonymization, and 30-day raw data retention
- [ ] **Given** tracking failures, **when** events fail to submit, **then** they are cached locally with encryption, retried with exponential backoff, and achieve 99.9% eventual delivery success
- [ ] **Given** cross-device usage, **when** users switch between mobile devices, **then** sessions synchronize within 2 seconds with 95% accuracy maintaining behavioral context and preference continuity
- [ ] **Given** offline scenarios, **when** network is unavailable, **then** events are cached locally with 500MB storage limit and synced when connection resumes with deduplication logic
- [ ] **Given** performance requirements, **when** under peak load, **then** the system maintains <50ms response time with 10,000+ concurrent events and <0.1% error rate
- [ ] **Given** data retention policies, **when** automated cleanup runs, **then** user data is purged after 365 days with immediate deletion on request and verifiable compliance reports
- [ ] **Given** biometric security, **when** accessing sensitive tracking data, **then** Face ID/Touch ID authentication is required for preference management and data export functions
- [ ] **Given** session tracking, **when** user activity patterns change, **then** behavioral segmentation updates within 5 minutes with 85% accuracy for personalization signals
- [ ] **Given** event validation, **when** malformed or suspicious events are detected, **then** they are quarantined with <0.01% false positive rate and administrator notification
