- **73%** want to continue shopping across devices without losing progress
- **65%** need longer cart persistence for items they're considering purchasing
- Cross-device shoppers show **2.8x higher conversion rates** when cart sync works properly

### Business Impact
**Direct Revenue Impact:**
- **Cart Recovery**: Persistent cart system reduces abandonment by 40%
- **Conversion Enhancement**: Cross-device sync drives 25% higher purchase completion
- **User Retention**: Seamless shopping experience increases 30-day retention by 35%
- **Average Order Value**: Multi-device shopping increases AOV by 15% due to more thoughtful selection

## Business Value & Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Cart Persistence Rate**: 95%+ of users retain cart items after app restart
- **Cross-Device Sync Time**: <2 seconds for cart updates to appear on other devices

5. Users can restore cart from any point in last 30 days. Verification: Create cart snapshots over time, restore from previous dates, confirm accuracy.
6. Anonymous users have cart data retained for 24 hours with proper cleanup. Verification: Add items as anonymous user, wait 24 hours, confirm data is removed.
7. Authenticated users have encrypted cart data synchronized across devices. Verification: Check data encryption and cross-device consistency.
8. Conflict resolution prioritizes most recent changes while preserving user intent. Verification: Simulate concurrent modifications, confirm resolution behavior.

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview
The shopping cart system follows the established layered architecture pattern:
- **Data Layer**: CartStorageService for local persistence, CartSyncService for cross-device synchronization

- **Session Management**: Configurable session timeout with auto-renewal based on user activity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins strategy with user intent preservation for concurrent modifications
- **Anonymous Handling**: Time-limited cart retention policy (24 hours) for non-authenticated users
- **Data Efficiency**: Storage optimization to maintain <5KB per item including metadata
- **Analytics Integration**: Cart analytics service for tracking user behavior and funnel optimization

### Required Dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Feature Architecture
The shopping cart system should follow the existing feature directory structure pattern:
- `/lib/features/cart/` - Main feature directory
  - `data/` - Repository and data source implementations
    - `repositories/` - CartRepository for handling cart operations
    - `datasources/` - Local and remote data sources for cart storage
    - `services/` - CartStorageService, CartSyncService, CartService
  - `domain/` - Business logic, entities, and use cases
    - `entities/` - CartModel, CartItemModel
    - `usecases/` - Cart operations (add, remove, update, sync, restore)
  - `presentation/` - UI components, screens, and state management
    - `bloc/` - CartBloc for state management
    - `widgets/` - UI components for cart display and interaction
    - `screens/` - Main cart screen

### State Management Approach
Use the existing BLoC pattern as implemented in other features:
- Create `CartBloc` following the pattern in `/lib/features/commerce/presentation/bloc/`
- Define clear events for all cart operations (AddItem, RemoveItem, UpdateQuantity, SyncCart, RestoreCart)
- Implement proper state management with CartLoading, CartLoaded, CartError states
- Use event debouncing for sync operations to prevent excessive network calls

### Cross-feature Integration Points
1. **Authentication (Story 1.1)**:
   - Use existing auth system for user identification
   - Implement anonymous cart handling for non-authenticated users
   - Connect to authentication state changes for cart initialization
2. **Device Management (Story 1.8)**:
   - Integrate with device management for cross-device identification
   - Use device-specific settings for cart behavior customization
3. **Privacy Controls (Story 1.9)**:
   - Implement encryption for cart data storage per security requirements
   - Follow privacy guidelines for data handling and user consent

### Database Schema
Using Hive for local storage:
- Create `CartBox` for storing CartModel instances
- Define `CartItemAdapter` for efficient CartItemModel storage
- Add indexes for performance on frequently queried fields (userId, updatedAt)
- Implement box compaction to maintain storage efficiency

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Network Failures**: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for sync operations
- **Data Conflicts**: Handle concurrent modifications with last-write-wins strategy and user notifications
- **Storage Limits**: Manage scenarios where local storage is full with graceful degradation
- **Session Timeout**: Handle expired sessions with proper user guidance and cart preservation
