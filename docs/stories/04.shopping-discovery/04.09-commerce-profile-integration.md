## Priority
Medium

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation depends on **Story 1.7: User Profile Management and Commerce Integration** for profile data and user account management.

## Story

   - [ ] Profile activity includes commerce history and preferences

2. **Commerce-Profile Data Synchronization**
   - [ ] Commerce purchases update profile activity history
   - [ ] Profile preferences sync with commerce personalization
   - [ ] Commerce notifications respect profile notification settings
   - [ ] Profile data supports commerce account management
   - [ ] Commerce features integrate with profile security settings

3. **Cross-Domain Integration**
   - [ ] Commerce system securely accesses profile data
   - [ ] Profile changes trigger appropriate commerce updates
   - [ ] Commerce actions generate profile audit logs
   - [ ] Profile privacy controls apply to commerce features
   - [ ] Commerce personalization respects user preferences

## Dependencies
- Story 1.7: User Profile Management and Commerce Integration
- Story 1.1: Authentication system foundation
- Story 1.8: Device management capabilities
- Serverpod for backend services
- Flutter profile feature module

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-09-19 | 1.0 | Initial commerce profile integration story | Claude Agent |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.1 | Identified specification misalignment with Flutter architecture | QA Team |
| 2025-02-15 | 1.2 | Identified missing module scaffolding in Flutter project | QA Team |

## QA Results
### Review Date: 2025-02-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Story still in Draft; all acceptance-criteria checkboxes and tasks remain unchecked. No implementation details map to the Flutter codebase, and referenced directories (`lib/features/commerce_profile/...`) do not exist.

### Refactoring Performed
- None. Specification requires re-alignment with actual project structure before work can start.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: Fails – referenced components/files do not exist in the Flutter repo and require rewrites.
- Project Structure: Fails – file paths point to non-existent modules.
- Testing Strategy: Incomplete – relies on mocked commerce services without defining them in the project.
- All ACs Met: No – no evidence of implementation.

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Update file paths and components to reference actual Flutter modules or add the missing structure.
- [ ] Provide concrete implementation notes tying acceptance criteria to existing services.

### Security Review
- Deferred – cannot evaluate until integration points and data-access patterns are defined for the Flutter app.

### Performance Considerations
- Deferred – personalization and synchronization flows need to be scoped before evaluation.

### Final Status
- Remains Draft until the specification is reconciled with the repository architecture and actionable implementation steps are documented.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- Searched the repo and confirmed there is no `lib/features/commerce_profile` or `test/features/commerce_profile` directory; engineers will need either new module scaffolding guidance or updated paths that map to existing Flutter features (`cart`, `profile`, etc.).
- Tasks/AC checkboxes remain entirely unchecked, leaving no artifacts that demonstrate partial implementation—capture concrete commits or keep the story in Draft to prevent premature handoffs.
