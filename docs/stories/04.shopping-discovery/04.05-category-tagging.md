# Story 3.5: Category and Tagging System

## 1. Title
Hierarchical Category System and Flexible Content Tagging Framework

## 2. Context
This story establishes the foundational content organization system for Video Window, implementing both hierarchical categories and flexible tagging to enable intelligent content discovery and navigation. The system supports the entire content ecosystem including user-generated content, commerce products, and editorial content. Market research indicates that well-structured categorization improves content discovery by 45% and user satisfaction by 32%. This system will serve as the backbone for search, recommendations, feed filtering, and commerce integration, providing a unified taxonomy across all content types.

## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validated Process Rules:**

### Development Process
- **Phase Approach**: Implement in 3 phases (Core Taxonomy → Commerce Integration → Cross-Domain Testing)
- **Data-Driven Development**: All classification algorithms require baseline testing and validation
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each categorization feature delivered as independently testable units
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review with focus on data model consistency
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit → Integration → Cross-domain → Performance testing sequence

### Integration Rules
- **Unified Taxonomy**: All domains must use the same category hierarchy and tag system
- **Data Consistency**: Category and tag data must remain consistent across all systems
- **Performance**: All categorization operations must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Scalability**: System must handle growth in categories, tags, and content volume
- **Backward Compatibility**: Category and tag changes must not break existing content relationships

### Naming Conventions
- **File Structure**: Follow domain-based organization (`lib/features/categorization/`, `backend/services/categorization/`)
- **Component Naming**: Use descriptive names with domain prefixes (`CategoryBrowser`, `TagInput`)
- **API Endpoints**: Use RESTful conventions with domain prefixes (`/api/v1/categories/`, `/api/v1/tags/`)
- **Database Tables**: Use underscore naming with domain prefixes (`categories`, `tags`, `content_categories`)

### Quality Rules
- **Data Validation**: All category and tag operations must have proper validation
- **Performance**: All categorization operations must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Testing**: Minimum 90% test coverage for all categorization logic
- **Documentation**: All APIs and classification algorithms must be documented
- **Security**: Category management requires proper authorization and audit logging
