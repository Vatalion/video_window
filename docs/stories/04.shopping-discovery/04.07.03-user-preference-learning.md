# User Preference Learning for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Shopping & Discovery - Personalization

## Story
As a social commerce platform user,
I want the system to learn and adapt my content and product preferences over time,
so that I receive increasingly relevant craft content and creator product recommendations that match my evolving interests.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Static recommendations don't adapt to changing user interests, leading to decreased engagement and missed commerce opportunities
- **Solution**: Advanced machine learning system with hybrid neural collaborative filtering, real-time adaptation, and privacy-preserving techniques
- **Impact**: 40% increase in user retention, 35% improvement in recommendation relevance, 30% increase in commerce conversion, and 25% boost in creator product sales

## Executive Summary
This comprehensive user preference learning system represents a significant advancement in personalization technology for social commerce platforms. By implementing state-of-the-art ML techniques including hybrid neural collaborative filtering, transformer-based sequential modeling, and privacy-preserving federated learning, the system will deliver highly personalized experiences while maintaining user privacy and regulatory compliance.

The solution addresses critical challenges in modern personalization: cold-start problems, preference evolution, cross-domain learning between content and commerce, and the need for transparent, explainable recommendations. With support for 5+ million concurrent users and real-time preference updates, the system scales to meet enterprise demands while maintaining sub-100ms latency requirements.

- [ ] **Given** model training failures, **when** errors occur, **then** the system rolls back to stable version within 10 minutes with automated alerts and fallback to simpler models
- [ ] **Given** social commerce behavior, **when** users interact with creator content and products, **then** preferences transfer between content and commerce with 70% correlation accuracy using cross-domain embedding
- [ ] **Given** user preference management, **when** users adjust settings or provide explicit preferences, **then** changes reflect in recommendations within 15 minutes with 95% consistency
- [ ] **Given** privacy requirements, **when** preference data is processed, **then** it complies with GDPR/CCPA with explicit consent management, federated learning options, and differential privacy
- [ ] **Given** mobile performance requirements, **when** processing preferences, **then** the system handles 1M+ users with <100ms latency, <50ms on-device inference, and battery usage <5% per session
- [ ] **Given** model drift detection, **when** accuracy degradation exceeds 10%, **then** automated retraining triggers within 30 minutes with root cause analysis
- [ ] **Given** user preference evolution, **when** interests shift over time, **then** the system detects and adapts to preference changes within 7 days using temporal decay functions and novelty detection
