### Core Components Implementation

#### 1. Cart Data Models
```dart
// Cart Item Model
class CartItem {
  final String id;
  final String productId;
  final String variantId;
  final String creatorId;
  int quantity;
  double unitPrice;
  double totalPrice;
  DateTime addedAt;
  DateTime? updatedAt;
  Map<String, dynamic> metadata;
  CartItemStatus status;
  List<CartItemOption> options;
  SocialProofData? socialProof;
  InventoryData? inventory;

  // Methods for cart operations
  void updateQuantity(int newQuantity);
  double calculateTotal();
  bool isValid();
  CartItem copyWith({...});
}

// Cart Model
class Cart {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  List<CartItem> items;
  CartStatus status;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime updatedAt;
  CartSummary summary;
  PersonalizationData? personalization;
  AppliedPromotions? promotions;

  // Cart operations
  void addItem(CartItem item);
  void removeItem(String itemId);
  void updateQuantity(String itemId, int quantity);
  void clearCart();
  double calculateTotal();
  bool isEmpty();
  int getTotalItems();
}
```

#### 2. BLoC State Management
```dart
// Cart Events
abstract class CartEvent {}
class AddToCart extends CartEvent {
  final CartItem item;
  AddToCart(this.item);
}
class RemoveFromCart extends CartEvent {
  final String itemId;
  RemoveFromCart(this.itemId);
}
class UpdateQuantity extends CartEvent {
  final String itemId;
  final int quantity;
  UpdateQuantity(this.itemId, this.quantity);
}
class BulkOperation extends CartEvent {
  final List<CartOperation> operations;
  BulkOperation(this.operations);
}

// Cart States
abstract class CartState {}
class CartInitial extends CartState {}
class CartLoading extends CartState {}
class CartLoaded extends CartState {
  final Cart cart;
  CartLoaded(this.cart);
}
class CartError extends CartState {
  final String message;
  CartError(this.message);
}
```

#### 3. Repository Pattern
```dart
abstract class CartRepository {
  Future<Cart> getCart(String userId);
  Future<Cart> addToCart(String userId, CartItem item);
  Future<Cart> removeFromCart(String userId, String itemId);
  Future<Cart> updateQuantity(String userId, String itemId, int quantity);
  Future<Cart> clearCart(String userId);
  Future<Cart> bulkOperation(String userId, List<CartOperation> operations);
  Stream<Cart> cartStream(String userId);
}

class CartRepositoryImpl implements CartRepository {
  final CartRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final CartLocalDataSource localDataSource;
  final NetworkInfo networkInfo;

  // Implementation with caching, sync, and error handling
}
```

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Database Optimization
```dart
// Hive for local storage with optimized queries
class CartDatabase {
  late final Box<Cart> _cartBox;
  late final Box<CartItem> _itemBox;

  // Indexed queries for fast lookups
  Future<List<CartItem>> getItemsByCart(String cartId) {
    return _itemBox.values
        .where((item) => item.cartId == cartId)
        .toList();
  }

  // Batch operations for efficiency
  Future<void> bulkUpdate(List<CartItem> items) {
    return _itemBox.putAll(Map.fromIterable(
      items,
      key: (item) => item.id,
      value: (item) => item,
    ));
  }
}
```

#### 2. Memory Management
```dart
// Object pooling for cart items
class CartItemPool {
  final _pool = <String, CartItem>{};

  CartItem getItem(String id) {
    return _pool[id] ??= CartItem(id: id, ...);
  }

  void releaseItem(String id) {
    if (_pool.length > 100) {
      _pool.remove(id);
    }
  }
}

// Lazy loading for cart items
class LazyCartItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final String itemId;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<CartItem>(
      future: _loadItem(itemId),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return CartItemWidget(item: snapshot.data!);
        }
        return CartItemPlaceholder();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

#### 3. Network Optimization
```dart
// Request batching
class CartRequestBatcher {
  final _queue = <CartOperation>[];
  Timer? _timer;

  void addOperation(CartOperation operation) {
    _queue.add(operation);
    _timer?.cancel();
    _timer = Timer(Duration(milliseconds: 100), _processBatch);
  }

  Future<void> _processBatch() async {
    if (_queue.isEmpty) return;

    final batch = List<CartOperation>.from(_queue);
    _queue.clear();

    await _apiClient.bulkCartOperation(batch);
  }
}

// Response caching
class CartCache {
  final _cache = <String, CachedCart>{};

  Future<Cart?> getCart(String userId) async {
    final cached = _cache[userId];
    if (cached != null && !cached.isExpired) {
      return cached.data;
    }
    return null;
  }

  void setCart(String userId, Cart cart) {
    _cache[userId] = CachedCart(
      data: cart,
      timestamp: DateTime.now(),
      ttl: Duration(minutes: 5),
    );
  }
}
```

### Security Implementation

#### 1. Data Encryption
```dart
// Secure storage implementation
class SecureCartStorage {
  final FlutterSecureStorage _secureStorage;

  Future<void> storeCart(String userId, Cart cart) async {
    final json = jsonEncode(cart.toJson());
    final encrypted = await _encryptData(json);
    await _secureStorage.write(key: 'cart_$userId', value: encrypted);
  }

  Future<Cart?> getCart(String userId) async {
    final encrypted = await _secureStorage.read(key: 'cart_$userId');
    if (encrypted == null) return null;

    final json = await _decryptData(encrypted);
    return Cart.fromJson(jsonDecode(json));
  }
}
```

#### 2. API Security
```dart
// Secure API client
class SecureCartApiClient {
  final Dio _dio;
  final String _apiKey;

  SecureCartApiClient(this._dio, this._apiKey) {
    _dio.interceptors.addAll([
      AuthInterceptor(),
      RateLimitInterceptor(),
      EncryptionInterceptor(),
      LoggingInterceptor(),
    ]);
  }

  Future<ApiResponse<T>> secureCall<T>(
    Future<T> Function() call,
  ) async {
    try {
      final result = await call();
      return ApiResponse.success(result);
    } on DioException catch (e) {
      return ApiResponse.error(
        message: _handleError(e),
        statusCode: e.response?.statusCode,
      );
    }
  }
}
```

      mockRepository = MockCartRepository();
      cartBloc = CartBloc(repository: mockRepository);
    });

    test('initial state is CartInitial', () {
      expect(cartBloc.state, CartInitial());
    });

    blocTest<CartBloc, CartState>(
      'emits [CartLoading, CartLoaded] when AddToCart is added',
      build: () {
        when(() => mockRepository.addToCart(any(), any()))
            .thenAnswer((_) async => mockCart);
        return cartBloc;
      },
      act: (bloc) => bloc.add(AddToCart(mockCartItem)),
      expect: () => [
        CartLoading(),
        CartLoaded(mockCart),
      ],
    );
  });
}
```

  group('Cart Integration Tests', () {
    late CartService cartService;
    late MockApiService mockApiService;

    setUp(() {
      mockApiService = MockApiService();
      cartService = CartService(apiService: mockApiService);
    });

    test('add to cart and sync with server', () async {
      // Given
      final item = CartItem(id: '1', productId: 'p1', quantity: 1);

      // When
      await cartService.addToCart(item);

      // Then
      verify(() => mockApiService.addToCart(item)).called(1);
      expect(cartService.cart.items, contains(item));
    });
