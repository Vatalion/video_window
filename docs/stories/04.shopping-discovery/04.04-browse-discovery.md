## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- Specification references directories such as `lib/features/discovery/` that are absent from the project; navigation and UI plans need to be reconciled with the existing Flutter structure.
- All tasks remain unchecked, so the story is still conceptual—update with concrete implementation steps and dependency mapping before advancing status.

### Final Status
✗ Changes Required

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- Inventorying the repo shows no `lib/features/discovery` or `backend/services/discovery`; please outline how those modules will be introduced or re-point the file map to existing Flutter features.
- Key ACs require geolocation/maps, yet `pubspec.yaml` only provides `geolocator`—there is no map SDK or discovery-specific dependency, so call out how map-based browsing will be delivered.
- QA Results still use placeholders (`Review Date: YYYY-MM-DD`); capture the actual review metadata so future auditors know when and how this spec was evaluated.

## QA Findings (2025-02-16)
- File-location guidance (line 176 onward) continues to target missing `lib/features/discovery/` and backend directories; update paths or provide scaffolding instructions.
- The story remains Draft, but acceptance criteria rely on trending algorithms, location services, and personalization engines that lack concrete implementation steps—add Flutter-focused deliverables.
- Document the map SDK and other discovery dependencies required so engineering can budget for integration.
