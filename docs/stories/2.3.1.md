# Status
**Status:** Draft

# Story
**As a** craft creator,
**I want** a comprehensive draft management system with auto-save, versioning, and collaborative features,
**so that** I can safely create, modify, and collaborate on content before publishing.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Auto-save functionality with configurable intervals and recovery options
2. Draft version history with comparison and rollback capabilities
3. Draft preview and testing environment for content validation
4. Collaborative editing for team accounts with real-time updates
5. Template system for recurring content types and structures
6. Draft organization with folders, tags, and search functionality
7. Draft status management (Draft, Review, Ready to Publish)
8. Backup and synchronization with cloud storage

# Dev Notes
## Technical Requirements
- Create real-time data synchronization with WebSockets or similar
- Implement differential synchronization for collaborative editing
- Build version control system with efficient storage
- Create auto-save engine with conflict resolution
- Implement cloud storage integration for backup and sync
- Build preview rendering system for different platforms

## Integration Points
- User authentication system for creator profiles and permissions
- Content management system for draft storage
- Real-time messaging service for collaboration
- Cloud storage service for backup and synchronization
- Analytics service for draft performance tracking
- Notification system for status changes and collaboration
- Version control system for draft history

## Testing Requirements
- Test auto-save functionality and recovery options
- Validate version control and rollback features
- Test collaborative editing with multiple users
- Validate preview rendering across different devices
- Test template creation and application functionality
- Validate cloud synchronization and backup reliability
- Test draft organization and search functionality

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize real-time synchronization for minimal latency
- Implement efficient version storage with delta encoding
- Minimize memory usage for large draft files
- Ensure responsive collaborative editing interface
- Optimize auto-save performance for continuous operation
- Implement caching for frequently accessed templates
- Minimize network usage for cloud synchronization
