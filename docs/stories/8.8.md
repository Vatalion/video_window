# Story: Webhook Endpoint Management

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive webhook endpoint management system with secure delivery, event processing, and monitoring capabilities.

## 2. Context
Webhooks are essential for real-time integration with external services, enabling the application to notify other systems about important events such as payment processing, user actions, and system updates. As a backend developer, I need to implement webhook endpoint management so that the application can send real-time notifications to external systems and integrate with third-party services effectively. This requires a robust webhook management system that can handle high volume, ensure reliable delivery, provide proper security, and support various event types while maintaining performance and reliability.

## 3. Requirements
- **Webhook Endpoint Configuration**: Create webhook endpoint registration system, implement endpoint validation and testing, set up webhook subscription management, create endpoint security and authentication
- **Webhook Payload Structure**: Design standardized webhook payload format, implement event type classification, create payload versioning and compatibility, set up payload encryption and signing
- **Webhook Delivery System**: Implement webhook delivery queue, create retry and failure handling logic, set up delivery monitoring and tracking, implement delivery optimization strategies
- **Webhook Security**: Implement webhook signature verification, set up endpoint authentication mechanisms, create webhook security headers, implement IP whitelisting and restrictions
- **Event Management**: Create event type definitions, implement event filtering and routing, set up event batching and aggregation, create event prioritization system
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Set up webhook delivery monitoring, create failure rate analytics, implement delivery performance tracking, set up webhook health checks
- **Management Interface**: Create webhook management dashboard, implement endpoint testing tools, set up webhook activity logging, create webhook configuration API

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Webhook endpoints can be registered and configured with proper validation
- Webhook payloads follow standardized format with proper event typing
- Delivery system handles retries and failures with exponential backoff
- Security measures prevent unauthorized access with signature verification
- Event filtering works correctly based on subscription preferences
- Monitoring provides delivery insights with performance metrics
- Management interface is user-friendly with comprehensive features
- Performance handles high webhook volume with proper queueing
- All webhook types work in production with reliable delivery

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Security**: Implement proper security measures for webhook delivery
- **Reliability**: Ensure reliable webhook delivery with proper retry logic
- **Performance**: Optimize webhook delivery for high volume scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear webhook documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Test webhook functionality thoroughly before deployment
- **Scalability**: Design systems to handle growing webhook volume
- **Compliance**: Follow relevant security and compliance requirements
