# Story 01.04: Biometric Authentication

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Security

## Story
As a frequent shopper or creator,
I want to unlock the app with Face ID or Touch ID/Android biometrics with instant commerce resume,
so that I can complete high-value purchases and access creator tools instantly without compromising security.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Biometric auth is positioned as generic security rather than commerce enabler, missing opportunities to drive conversion and reduce cart abandonment.
- **Solution**: Implement biometric authentication as a commerce-first feature that provides instant access to high-value actions while maintaining robust security.
- **Impact**: Increase checkout completion by 15%, reduce cart abandonment by 25%, and improve user satisfaction scores by 35% through seamless re-authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user in checkout or high-value flow, **When** biometric auth triggers, **Then** the system provides one-tap resume for cart/checkout/tipping with tactile haptic confirmation and deep link navigation to exact last intent, maintaining session context without friction.
- [ ] **Given** biometric unlock attempts, **When** measuring performance, **Then** the system achieves p50 < 800ms and p95 < 1.5s with opt-in rate > 60% on eligible devices and checkout completion lift +3-5% vs. password re-entry control.
- [ ] **Given** repeated biometric failures, **When** security risks increase, **Then** the system auto-escalates to MFA on 3 failures, revokes credentials on device-loss within 2s, and enforces strong biometrics only for enrollment.
- [ ] **Given** user behavior patterns, **When** friction is detected, **Then** the system suggests biometric enablement after 2nd checkout or during friction points using contextual messaging explaining commerce benefits and time savings.
- [ ] **Given** shared device usage, **When** multiple users access, **Then** the system prevents unauthorized access with session isolation, biometric lockout, device switch detection, and re-authentication requirements.
- [ ] **Given** cross-platform needs, **When** users switch devices, **Then** the system provides unified biometric experience across iOS (Face ID/Touch ID) and Android (fingerprint/face unlock) with platform-native prompts and haptic feedback.
- [ ] **Given** biometric implementation, **When** monitoring effectiveness, **Then** the system tracks unlock success rates, conversion lift, and friction points with 5% holdout group for A/B testing biometric vs. password flows.
- [ ] **Given** any biometric path, **When** users interact, **Then** all paths support VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic text scaling, and include clear fallback guidance with localized empathetic copy.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Checkout completion rate increase of 20%, cart abandonment reduction of 30%, high-value action completion rate improvement of 25%, conversion lift from biometric auth +5-8%
- **Technical Metric**: Biometric unlock latency p50 < 800ms, p95 < 1.5s; opt-in rate > 65%; system availability 99.95%; biometric creation success rate >98%
- **User Metric**: User satisfaction score > 4.7/5, biometric adoption rate > 70%, support ticket reduction for auth issues by 75%, authentication time reduction vs password >80%
- **Security Metric**: Biometric spoof prevention rate >99.9%, unauthorized access prevention rate 100%, secure storage compliance 100%

## Technical Requirements
- Implement biometric authentication using `local_auth` package with cross-platform Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint support and FIDO2 compliance
- Build commerce-aware deep linking system that preserves cart, checkout, and creator tool context with state management
- Deploy intelligent biometric prompting system that detects checkout friction and suggests enablement using machine learning
- Configure shared device protection with session isolation, device switch detection, and user profile separation
- Ensure cross-platform consistency with native platform integrations, haptic feedback, and platform-specific design patterns
- Implement performance monitoring with real-time analytics, A/B testing infrastructure, and SLO compliance tracking
- Build adaptive prompting engine with contextual benefit messaging, conversion tracking, and user behavior analysis
- Deploy comprehensive security measures including secure enrollment, anti-spoofing protection, and audit logging

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Native biometric APIs, secure storage system, session management, MFA fallback system
- **Business**: UX team for commerce flow integration, security team for biometric policies, legal team for compliance requirements
- **Prerequisites**: Story 01.03 (Multi-Factor Authentication) for fallback methods, Story 01.05 (Session Management) for context preservation

## Out of Scope
- Advanced biometric methods beyond native device capabilities
- Hardware token integration or external biometric devices
- Biometric data storage or processing beyond device-local verification
- Complex biometric preference management beyond basic enablement

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test all biometric components with >95% coverage including enrollment, authentication, and error handling
- **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end biometric flows with different device types and platform-specific implementations
- **Performance Testing**: Validate SLOs for biometric unlock times under various conditions and device states
- **Security Testing**: Conduct biometric spoofing tests, vulnerability assessments, and secure storage validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for biometric UI and fallback mechanisms
- **A/B Testing**: Implement holdout groups (5%) for measuring conversion lift vs traditional authentication methods

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Device Compatibility**: Graceful fallback for devices without biometric capabilities or disabled biometrics
- **Failed Attempts**: Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and progressive security escalation
- **Hardware Issues**: Detection and handling of faulty biometric sensors with user-friendly messaging
- **Shared Devices**: User profile isolation and biometric data separation for multi-user environments
- **Battery Saving Modes**: Biometric authentication behavior during low-power states and background processes
