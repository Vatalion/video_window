## 2. Context
This story exists to provide users with a convenient and secure authentication method that leverages device biometric capabilities. As mobile users increasingly expect seamless authentication experiences, biometric authentication offers both security and convenience. This implementation builds upon the authentication foundation established in Story 1.1 and the security enhancements from Story 1.3, providing users with faster access while maintaining robust security standards.

## 3. Requirements
The following requirements have been validated by the Product Owner:

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Support Face ID authentication on compatible iOS devices
- **FR2**: Support Touch ID authentication on compatible iOS devices
- **FR3**: Enable biometric authentication alongside existing password and 2FA methods
- **FR4**: Provide biometric setup option during user registration with clear user guidance
- **FR5**: Allow users to enable/disable biometric authentication in settings with immediate effect
- **FR6**: Implement fallback authentication when biometric authentication fails with automatic redirect
- **FR7**: Ensure biometric data is never stored or transmitted from the device (zero local storage policy)
- **FR8**: Provide comprehensive error handling for biometric authentication failures with user-friendly messages
- **FR9**: Implement biometric authentication lockout after multiple failed attempts (5 consecutive failures, 5-minute cooldown)
- **FR10**: Ensure compliance with Apple biometric authentication guidelines and Android biometric best practices

### Technical Requirements
- **TR1**: Use local_auth Flutter package for biometric integration with version constraint: ^1.1.0
- **TR2**: Store biometric preferences in iOS Keychain/Android Keystore using flutter_secure_storage package
- **TR3**: Implement device capability detection for biometric support using device_info_plus package
- **TR4**: Create biometric session management with automatic token refresh every 30 minutes
- **TR5**: Build backend API endpoints for biometric device registration and authentication with the following specifications:
  - POST /api/auth/biometric/register - Register a new biometric device with user account
  - POST /api/auth/biometric/authenticate - Authenticate user using biometric data
  - POST /api/auth/biometric/disable - Disable biometric authentication for user
  - GET /api/auth/biometric/status - Check if biometric authentication is enabled for user

### Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Authentication system foundation
- **Story 1.3**: Two-factor authentication implementation

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
The following testable acceptance criteria have been verified by QA:

1. **Given** a user has a Face ID-compatible device, **when** they attempt biometric setup, **then** Face ID authentication should be available and functional with response time < 1 second
2. **Given** a user has a Touch ID-compatible device, **when** they attempt biometric setup, **then** Touch ID authentication should be available and functional with response time < 1 second
3. **Given** a user has enabled biometric authentication, **when** they attempt login, **then** they should be able to use biometrics alongside password and 2FA methods with seamless fallback within 2 seconds
4. **Given** a user is completing initial registration, **when** they reach authentication setup, **then** they should have the option to enable biometric authentication with clear instructions and skip functionality
5. **Given** a user has biometric authentication enabled, **when** they access settings, **then** they should be able to disable biometric authentication with immediate effect and confirmation dialog
6. **Given** biometric authentication fails, **when** the user attempts login, **then** the system should provide fallback to password/2FA authentication within 2 seconds with clear error messaging
7. **Given** biometric authentication is in use, **when** authentication occurs, **then** biometric data should never be stored or transmitted from the device with zero local storage and verified through security audit
8. **Given** biometric authentication fails due to system errors, **when** an error occurs, **then** appropriate error handling should display user-friendly messages in English and offer retry option
9. **Given** multiple biometric authentication failures occur (5 consecutive), **when** the threshold is reached, **then** biometric authentication should be temporarily disabled for 5 minutes with clear user notification
10. **Given** the biometric authentication system is implemented, **when** reviewed against Apple and Android guidelines, **then** all compliance requirements should be met with documented evidence and security certifications

## 5. Process & Rules
The following workflow and rules have been validated by the Scrum Master:

### Development Process
- **Incremental Development**: Implement biometric authentication in phases, starting with basic authentication capability
- **Security-First Approach**: All biometric implementations must pass security review before UI integration
- **Device Testing**: Must test on real devices with both Face ID and Touch ID capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Implementation must work on both iOS and Android devices
- **Privacy Compliance**: All implementations must adhere to Apple's and Android's biometric data handling guidelines

### Code Quality Rules
- **Testing Requirements**: 100% test coverage for all biometric services and utilities
- **Security Standards**: Follow established security patterns from Stories 1.1 and 1.3
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance Target**: Biometric authentication response time < 1 second
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use consistent `biometric_` prefix for all biometric-related classes, methods, and variables
- Follow existing authentication system naming patterns established in Stories 1.1-1.3
- Maintain consistency with Flutter and Dart naming conventions

### Integration Rules
- All biometric features must integrate seamlessly with existing authentication flows
- Biometric authentication should complement, not replace, existing authentication methods
- Must maintain backward compatibility with non-biometric authentication
- Integration must preserve existing user data and preferences
