# Story 01.01: User Registration

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Identity & Access Foundation

## Story
As a new shopper or creator,
I want to register instantly using passkeys or autofill with personalized onboarding,
so that I can immediately access engaging commerce and video features with minimal friction.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Current registration flows are compliance-heavy and lack addictive user experiences, leading to high drop-off rates and missed first-week engagement opportunities.
- **Solution**: Implement a frictionless, mobile-first registration system with passkey-first authentication, social commerce integration, and personalized hooks that drive immediate engagement.
- **Impact**: Reduce registration abandonment by 40%, increase D1 activation by 35%, and improve Week1 retention by 25% through addictive, commerce-aware onboarding.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a new user launches the app, **When** they begin registration, **Then** the system offers passkey creation as the primary path with completion time <20s p50 and one-tap authentication, achieving 95% passkey adoption rate on eligible devices.
- [ ] **Given** a user chooses email/phone registration, **When** they start typing, **Then** the system auto-detects and pre-fills available contact information using OS autofill, reducing manual input to essential fields only with 95% accuracy rate.
- [ ] **Given** a registration attempt, **When** the system detects suspicious patterns, **Then** it implements device fingerprinting, IP rate limiting (3 attempts per minute), disposable email detection, and proof-of-human challenges for high-risk registrations, blocking 99% of bot attempts while maintaining <1% false positive rate.
- [ ] **Given** successful verification, **When** the user completes registration, **Then** they are immediately deep-linked to a personalized content preview with 3 follow suggestions and opt-in notifications primer, achieving 80% tap-through rate and 25% increase in first-session engagement.
- [ ] **Given** a new user profile, **When** the onboarding flow completes, **Then** non-essential profile data collection is deferred to post-signup nudges, reducing initial form completion time by 60% while maintaining 90% profile completion rate by Day 7.
- [ ] **Given** registration initiation, **When** the user completes the flow, **Then** total completion time maintains p50 <20s and p95 <45s with email/SMS verification completing within 5s p50, all instrumented with real-time monitoring and alerting for SLO breaches.
- [ ] **Given** the registration funnel, **When** users drop off at any stage, **Then** the system tracks drop-off with reason codes, success KPIs (D1 activation, Week1 retention, first add-to-cart), and includes 5-10% holdout groups for A/B testing with statistical significance >95%.
- [ ] **Given** successful registration, **When** the user enters the app, **Then** they receive refer-a-friend prompts, personalized content recommendations, and onboarding streaks that drive first-week retention to 40% with measurable viral coefficient >0.3.
- [ ] **Given** any registration path, **When** a user interacts with the flow, **Then** all paths support VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic text scaling, and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all interaction modes with 100% accessibility audit pass rate.
- [ ] **Given** technical constraints, **When** a user cannot use preferred methods, **Then** magic links provide passwordless authentication fallback, and pre-KYC merchant flags route eligible users to creator onboarding flows with 85% routing accuracy.
- [ ] **Given** network conditions, **When** connectivity is poor, **Then** registration flow supports offline mode with local state persistence and automatic retry logic, maintaining 90% completion rate even under 3G conditions.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Registration completion rate increase from 60% to 85%, D1 activation rate increase from 40% to 75%, Week1 retention rate increase from 25% to 50%, viral coefficient >0.3 from referral programs
- **Technical Metric**: Registration completion time p50 <20s, p95 <45s; verification delivery latency p50 <5s; system availability 99.95%; passkey creation success rate >98%
- **User Metric**: Post-registration engagement rate (first session actions) >80%, user satisfaction score >4.5/5, support ticket reduction for registration issues by 70%, accessibility compliance rate 100%
- **Security Metric**: Bot registration prevention rate >99%, fraudulent account creation rate <0.1%, data breach prevention 100%

## Technical Requirements
- Implement passkey-first authentication using Flutter's `local_auth` and WebAuthn packages with p50 <800ms authentication time and FIDO2 compliance
- Integrate OS autofill APIs for email/phone detection with 95% accuracy rate and fallback mechanisms for unsupported devices
- Deploy device fingerprinting using `device_info_plus` with unique identifier hashing, privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA), and secure storage practices
- Configure anti-abuse systems with rate limiting, disposable email API integration, reCAPTCHA Enterprise, and behavioral analysis for pattern detection
- Build progressive profiling system with deferred data collection, nudge-based completion, and intelligent data validation
- Implement real-time analytics pipeline with funnel tracking, reason codes, A/B testing infrastructure, and machine learning-based optimization
- Ensure offline capability for form state persistence with conflict resolution on reconnect and bandwidth optimization for mobile networks
- Deploy comprehensive security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, and automated compliance checks

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Serverpod backend integration, SendGrid/Twilio messaging services, device fingerprinting service, anti-abuse APIs, real-time analytics pipeline
- **Business**: Legal team for COPPA compliance documentation, marketing team for referral program assets, design team for UX copy and flows, security team for threat modeling
- **Prerequisites**: Story 01.05 (Session Management) for state persistence, Story 01.08 (Device Management) for fingerprinting, Story 01.09 (Privacy Security Audit) for compliance measures

## Out of Scope
- Full KYC verification (deferred to Story 01.10)
- Advanced social graph analysis during registration
- Multi-factor authentication setup during initial registration
- Complex preference surveys during onboarding
- Third-party identity provider integration beyond Google/Apple/Facebook
- Advanced behavioral biometrics beyond device fingerprinting

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test all registration components with >95% coverage including edge cases and error conditions
- **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end registration flows with different authentication methods and network conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Validate SLOs for registration completion times under various load conditions (1000+ concurrent users)
- **Security Testing**: Conduct penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and compliance validation (GDPR/CCPA/COPPA)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with automated and manual testing across device types
- **A/B Testing**: Implement holdout groups (5-10%) for continuous optimization of registration flows

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with offline support and automatic retry logic
- **Device Compatibility**: Fallback mechanisms for older devices without passkey support
- **Rate Limiting**: User-friendly messaging and exponential backoff for blocked attempts
- **Data Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages and correction suggestions
- **Service Outages**: Circuit breaker patterns and fallback authentication methods during provider downtime
