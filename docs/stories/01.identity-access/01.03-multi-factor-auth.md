# 1.3 Multi-Factor Authentication System

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Epic
User Authentication System (1.0) - Enhance account security by implementing multi-factor authentication options to protect user accounts against unauthorized access.

## Story
As a security-conscious user,
I want to enable multi-factor authentication on my account using SMS or authenticator app methods,
so that I can protect my account from unauthorized access and meet industry security standards.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple and intuitive 2FA setup process that can be completed in under 5 minutes
- Clear guidance during 2FA configuration with visual feedback
- Minimal disruption to login flow while maintaining security
- Multiple recovery options to prevent account lockout
- Accessibility compliance for users with disabilities

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: All 2FA setup actions positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **QR Code Scanning**: Optimized camera view for QR code scanning with clear focus area
- **Code Entry**: Numeric keypad for TOTP code entry with proper spacing
- **Recovery Options**: Clear presentation of backup code and recovery options

### Visual Design System
- **Security Theme**: Visual design that conveys trust and security
- **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance with visual indicators
- **Error State Visualization**: Clear error indicators when 2FA verification fails
- **Success Confirmation**: Visual feedback when 2FA is successfully enabled

### Platform-Specific UI Patterns
- **iOS Design Language**: Follow iOS security guidelines for 2FA implementation
- **Android Material Design**: Use Material Design principles for all 2FA components
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified 2FA experience across platforms

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **SMS 2FA Setup**: Given a user with a verified phone number, when they enable SMS 2FA, then they receive a verification code via SMS and can complete setup
2. **TOTP 2FA Setup**: Given a user with an authenticator app, when they enable TOTP 2FA, then they can scan a QR code or enter manual setup details to complete setup
3. **Registration Integration**: Given a new user during registration, when they reach the security settings step, then they can optionally set up 2FA
4. **Settings Management**: Given a user with enabled 2FA, when they access account settings, then they can view, disable, or change their 2FA method
5. **Backup Code Generation**: Given a user who enables 2FA, when the setup is complete, then they receive 10 backup codes for account recovery
6. **Sensitive Action Protection**: Given a user with enabled 2FA, when they attempt sensitive account actions, then they must complete 2FA verification
7. **New Device Grace Period**: Given a user on a new device, when they log in for the first time, then they have a 24-hour grace period to set up 2FA
8. **Account Recovery**: Given a user who loses access to their 2FA method, when they initiate account recovery, then they can use backup codes or verified email recovery
9. **Error Handling**: Given a user entering an invalid 2FA code, when they submit the code, then they receive clear error messaging without revealing system information
10. **Security Compliance**: Given the MFA implementation, when security testing is performed, then all OWASP and industry security standards are met

## Implementation Details

### Domain Terminology
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: A security method that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: An algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time (RFC 6238)
- **Backup Codes**: Single-use codes provided to users for account recovery when 2FA methods are unavailable
- **Grace Period**: A 24-hour window during which users can access their account on a new device before 2FA is enforced

### Data Models
- **User Model**: Extend existing user model with 2FA configuration fields:
  - mfa_enabled (boolean)
  - mfa_method (enum: sms, totp, none)
  - mfa_secret (encrypted string)
  - mfa_phone_number (string, encrypted)
  - backup_codes (array of hashed strings)
  - last_mfa_setup (timestamp)
- **MFA Session Model**: Track 2FA verification states:
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - device_id (string)
  - verified (boolean)
  - grace_period_expires (timestamp)

### Flutter Dependencies Required
The following dependencies are already declared in `pubspec.yaml`:
- `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.2` (for secure credential storage)
- `qr_flutter: ^4.1.0` (for QR code generation)
- `google_sign_in: ^6.2.1` (for Google authentication)
- `flutter_bloc: ^8.1.5` (for state management)
- `mocktail: ^1.0.4` (for testing mocks)

### File Structure
- **Feature Location**: Implement within `lib/features/auth/`
- **Service Layer**: `lib/features/auth/data/services/` - 2FA service classes
- **Presentation Layer**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/` - 2FA UI components
- **State Management**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/` - Extend AuthBloc with 2FA events
- **Models**: `lib/features/auth/domain/entities/` - Extend user models with 2FA fields
- **Screens**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/` - 2FA setup and management screens
- **Routes**: `lib/features/auth/presentation/routes/` - Define routes for 2FA flows

### API Specifications
- **POST /api/mfa/setup**: Initiate 2FA setup, send verification code
- **POST /api/mfa/verify**: Verify 2FA code, complete setup
- **POST /api/mfa/disable**: Disable 2FA, require re-authentication
- **POST /api/mfa/backup-codes**: Generate new backup codes
- **POST /api/mfa/recovery**: Recovery using backup codes or email

### Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data (secrets, phone numbers) must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for SMS and verification attempts to prevent abuse
- **Session Security**: Ensure secure handling of sessions during 2FA verification
- **Error Handling**: Do not reveal system information in error messages

### Performance Considerations
- MFA verification response time should be < 3 seconds
- Memory usage during 2FA flows should be < 50MB
- SMS delivery should be reliable with proper error handling
- TOTP code generation and validation should be efficient
