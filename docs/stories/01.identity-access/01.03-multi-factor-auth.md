# Story 01.03: Multi-Factor Authentication

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Security

## Story
As a security-conscious user,
I want adaptive multi-factor authentication that protects high-value actions without disrupting my shopping experience,
so that I can feel secure while maintaining seamless access to commerce and creator features.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional MFA creates blanket friction that disrupts commerce flows, leading to cart abandonment and creator frustration during critical moments.
- **Solution**: Implement adaptive, risk-based MFA that intelligently steps up security only when necessary while preserving commerce continuity through contextual challenges.
- **Impact**: Reduce security incidents by 85% while maintaining 95% checkout completion rates and improving user trust scores by 40%.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user session, **When** risk signals are detected, **Then** the system triggers step-up verification based on adaptive risk scoring (new device, geo anomaly, payment risk, session anomalies) while skipping MFA for trusted, low-risk sessions to reduce friction by 70%, with false-positive rate <1%.
- [ ] **Given** an MFA challenge, **When** a user responds, **Then** the system uses push-to-approve with p50 < 5s response time as the primary method, with biometric fallback available when enrolled, achieving challenge success rate > 90% and average completion time <15s.
- [ ] **Given** a checkout or payout attempt, **When** MFA is triggered, **Then** checkout, payouts, and creator tool access trigger MFA with signed deep links that preserve cart/creation context, maintaining 98% commerce completion rate and <2% cart abandonment due to MFA.
- [ ] **Given** unavailable push/biometric methods, **When** traditional MFA is needed, **Then** SMS/TOTP methods provide backup with clear UX guidance, OTP delivery p95 < 5s, and intelligent rate limiting (3 attempts per 10 minutes) with exponential backoff.
- [ ] **Given** MFA enrollment, **When** a user sets up backup codes, **Then** the system provides 10 single-use backup codes with secure server-side hashing (argon2), one-time presentation with download/print options, and regeneration requiring identity confirmation with 99.9% security.
- [ ] **Given** a security event, **When** recovery is needed, **Then** recovery flows use verified email + backup code with empathetic UX, post-recovery security nudges, and trust score rebuilding guidance, achieving recovery completion p50 < 2 min and p95 < 4 min.
- [ ] **Given** a new device login, **When** no MFA is enrolled, **Then** the system provides a 24-hour grace period with contextual in-app reminders, progress indicators, and non-disruptive push/email notifications before enforcement, achieving 85% enrollment conversion.
- [ ] **Given** MFA implementation, **When** monitoring performance, **Then** the system maintains challenge success rate > 90%, false-positive step-ups < 1%, recovery completion p95 < 4 min, with 5% holdout for conversion impact measurement and statistical significance >95%.
- [ ] **Given** any MFA path, **When** a user interacts with MFA, **Then** all paths support VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic text scaling, and include localized empathetic copy with clear retry guidance, achieving 100% accessibility compliance.
- [ ] **Given** compliance requirements, **When** MFA is enforced, **Then** the system maintains GDPR/CCPA/SOC2 compliance with audit logging, data minimization, and automated compliance reporting, achieving 100% audit pass rate.
- [ ] **Given** network conditions, **When** connectivity is poor, **Then** MFA challenges support offline mode with cached credentials and automatic retry logic, maintaining 90% completion rate even under 3G conditions.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Security incident reduction of 85%, checkout completion rate maintenance at 98%, user trust score increase of 40%, MFA-driven cart abandonment <2%
- **Technical Metric**: Challenge success rate > 90%, false-positive step-up rate < 1%, OTP delivery p95 < 5s, system availability 99.99%, enrollment conversion rate 85%
- **User Metric**: MFA completion rate > 95%, user satisfaction score > 4.6/5, support ticket reduction for MFA issues by 75%, average completion time <15s
- **Security Metric**: Account takeover prevention rate >99.9%, backup code security 99.9%, compliance audit pass rate 100%

## Technical Requirements
- Implement adaptive risk engine using device fingerprinting, geo-velocity analysis, behavioral pattern recognition, and machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Deploy push-to-approve system using Firebase Cloud Messaging and DevicePush approval with biometric fallback integration and end-to-end encryption
- Build commerce-aware MFA with deep link preservation, context-aware challenge triggers, and intelligent session continuity
- Configure SMS/TOTP backup systems with Twilio integration, intelligent rate limiting protection, and anti-phishing measures
- Implement backup code management with secure server-side hashing (argon2), one-time presentation, and secure regeneration workflows
- Develop recovery flows with trust rebuilding mechanisms, security nudges, and comprehensive audit logging
- Ensure offline capability for challenge completion with deferred verification on reconnect and bandwidth optimization
- Deploy comprehensive monitoring and alerting for MFA performance, security events, and compliance requirements

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Risk scoring service, push notification infrastructure, biometric authentication system, SMS/TOTP providers, real-time analytics pipeline
- **Business**: Security team for risk model definitions and threat modeling, legal team for compliance requirements and audit preparation, UX team for empathetic flow design and accessibility
- **Prerequisites**: Story 01.04 (Biometric Authentication) for fallback methods, Story 01.05 (Session Management) for context preservation, Story 01.08 (Device Management) for fingerprinting

## Out of Scope
- Advanced biometric MFA methods beyond device-native capabilities
- Hardware token integration (YubiKey, etc.)
- Enterprise-grade MFA features beyond individual user protection
- Advanced behavioral biometrics beyond basic pattern recognition
