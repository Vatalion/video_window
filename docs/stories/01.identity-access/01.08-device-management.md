# Story 01.08: Device Management System

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Security

## Story
**As a** security-conscious user,
**I want** real-time control over my active sessions with live monitoring and instant actions,
**so that** I can protect my account with confidence while maintaining commerce continuity.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Device management is static and reactive, lacking real-time session orchestration and risk alerts that protect commerce activities.
- **Solution**: Implement live session control center with real-time monitoring, instant actions, and commerce context preservation.
- **Impact**: Reduce security incidents by 75%, improve user confidence in account security by 50%, and maintain commerce continuity during security events.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Live Session Control Center:** Real-time device list with pause/kick capabilities, push alerts on new device login (<5s), and one-tap revoke with biometric confirmation; session state updates reflect within 2 seconds across all devices.
2. **Performance KPIs:** Device revoke p95 < 2s, new-device alert < 5s, trust recalculation daily; security incident rate reduces by 50% post-launch; all metrics instrumented with real-time dashboards.
3. **Contextual Prompts:** During sensitive actions (checkout, large purchases, creator tools), system prompts users to review active devices with clear naming and geo hints; integrates with commerce flows seamlessly.
4. **Trust Scoring Engine:** Dynamic trust scores (0-100) based on usage patterns, location consistency, and behavior; daily recalculation with visual indicators and risk-based step-up verification.
5. **Co-Watch & Link Flows:** Secure device pairing for big-screen viewing with temporary elevated permissions during co-watch sessions; graceful cleanup after session ends.
6. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Live session status updates via WebSocket, immediate visual feedback for device actions, and audit trail with searchable history of all device events.
7. **Commerce Context Preservation:** Device revocation maintains critical commerce state (cart, creation progress) for recovery; handoff between devices preserves shopping and creator context.
8. **Measurement & Analytics:** Track time-to-revoke, incident reduction rates, and user outcomes; include 5% holdout groups to measure security vs. convenience impact.

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Story continues to use bespoke layout without template sections (`Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records); acceptance criteria numbered but missing metrics.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Implementation lacks Dev Notes summarizing fingerprinting approach, trust scoring models, or integration contracts with auth/session services.
  - No testing/QA plan for device sync, notifications, split payments, or geo-based controls.
  - Device inventory is static and reactive, ignoring real-time session orchestration and risk alerts.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria need measurable targets (notification SLA, trust score recalculation frequency) and instrumentation owners.
  - Tasks omit source tree references and dependency sequencing; risk of unaligned implementations.
  - Security/privacy requirements (device identifiers, geo data) must cite policies and retention rules.
  - Add live session control center with pause, risk notifications, and contextual prompts for linking big-screen or co-watch devices.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Add analytics plan for device trust trends, security incident detection, and user prompts.
  - Provide UX guidance for device labeling, alerts, and multi-device friction reductions.
  - Capture device engagement analytics and nudge creators when new devices join during events.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Trust scoring algorithm and biometric gating claims require architecture validation before committing.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **5 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

  - Device inventory is static and reactive, ignoring real-time session orchestration and risk alerts.

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, the biometric authentication implemented in **Story 1.4**, the session management from **Story 1.5**, and integrates with the profile management interface from **Story 1.7**.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Authentication & Security System (PRD section: Device Management Features) and enables users to monitor and control access to their accounts across multiple devices with comprehensive security tools.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing unauthorized account access by 90% and improving user security confidence by 85% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Unauthorized access prevention: Reduce security incidents by 90%
- User security confidence: Improve user trust rating by 85%
- Device management efficiency: Reduce time to manage devices by 70%
- Real-time security response: <5 second notification delivery for new device attempts
- Device trust accuracy: Maintain 95% correct trust scoring

## Domain Context
**Device Management** refers to the system that allows users to monitor, control, and secure access to their accounts across multiple devices. This includes registering new devices, viewing active sessions, and remotely managing device access.

**Device Fingerprinting** is a technique used to identify and track devices based on unique characteristics such as hardware ID, IP address, browser information, and installation identifiers.

**Trust Scoring** is a security mechanism that assigns a numerical score (0-100) to devices based on their behavior patterns, usage frequency, and consistency to help identify potentially suspicious devices.

**Risk-Based Authentication** is an adaptive authentication approach that adjusts security requirements based on the perceived risk of a transaction, often using device trust scores as one factor.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1, integrates with biometric authentication from Story 1.4, builds upon session management from Story 1.5, and connects to profile management from Story 1.7. The device management system will be implemented within the existing `lib/features/auth/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- DeviceService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/` for device fingerprinting and trust scoring
- DeviceModel and DeviceTrustModel in `lib/features/auth/domain/models/` for data representation
- DeviceBloc in `lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/` for state management
- DeviceList and DeviceDetails widgets in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/` for UI

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new device-related API endpoints.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Device List Navigation**: Swipe gestures to refresh device list, tap to view device details
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Device action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Security Actions**: One-tap device logout with confirmation swipe gesture
- **Biometric Integration**: Seamless biometric verification for sensitive device actions

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Device Card Layout**: Adaptive card-based layout for device display with key information
- **Trust Score Visualization**: Visual representation of trust scores with color-coded indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updating of device status with WebSocket integration
- **Empty State Handling**: Clear guidance when no devices are registered

### Visual Design System
- **Security Status Indicators**: Color-coded device status (green for trusted, yellow for medium trust, red for suspicious)
- **Device Type Icons**: Platform-specific icons for device recognition (iOS, Android, Web)
- **Trust Score Gauge**: Visual gauge or progress bar for trust scores (0-100)
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for security-focused viewing
