# Implementation: Story 1.8 - Device Management System

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, the biometric authentication implemented in **Story 1.4**, the session management from **Story 1.5**, and integrates with the profile management interface from **Story 1.7**.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Authentication & Security System (PRD section: Device Management Features) and enables users to monitor and control access to their accounts across multiple devices with comprehensive security tools.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing unauthorized account access by 90% and improving user security confidence by 85% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Unauthorized access prevention: Reduce security incidents by 90%
- User security confidence: Improve user trust rating by 85%
- Device management efficiency: Reduce time to manage devices by 70%
- Real-time security response: <5 second notification delivery for new device attempts
- Device trust accuracy: Maintain 95% correct trust scoring

## Domain Context
**Device Management** refers to the system that allows users to monitor, control, and secure access to their accounts across multiple devices. This includes registering new devices, viewing active sessions, and remotely managing device access.

**Device Fingerprinting** is a technique used to identify and track devices based on unique characteristics such as hardware ID, IP address, browser information, and installation identifiers.

**Trust Scoring** is a security mechanism that assigns a numerical score (0-100) to devices based on their behavior patterns, usage frequency, and consistency to help identify potentially suspicious devices.

**Risk-Based Authentication** is an adaptive authentication approach that adjusts security requirements based on the perceived risk of a transaction, often using device trust scores as one factor.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1, integrates with biometric authentication from Story 1.4, builds upon session management from Story 1.5, and connects to profile management from Story 1.7. The device management system will be implemented within the existing `lib/features/auth/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- DeviceService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/` for device fingerprinting and trust scoring
- DeviceModel and DeviceTrustModel in `lib/features/auth/domain/models/` for data representation
- DeviceBloc in `lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/` for state management
- DeviceList and DeviceDetails widgets in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/` for UI

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new device-related API endpoints.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Device List Navigation**: Swipe gestures to refresh device list, tap to view device details
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Device action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Security Actions**: One-tap device logout with confirmation swipe gesture
- **Biometric Integration**: Seamless biometric verification for sensitive device actions

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Device Card Layout**: Adaptive card-based layout for device display with key information
- **Trust Score Visualization**: Visual representation of trust scores with color-coded indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updating of device status with WebSocket integration
- **Empty State Handling**: Clear guidance when no devices are registered

### Visual Design System
- **Security Status Indicators**: Color-coded device status (green for trusted, yellow for medium trust, red for suspicious)
- **Device Type Icons**: Platform-specific icons for device recognition (iOS, Android, Web)
- **Trust Score Gauge**: Visual gauge or progress bar for trust scores (0-100)
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for security-focused viewing

## Story
**As a** security-conscious user,
**I want** to monitor and control access to my account across all devices,
**so that** I can prevent unauthorized access and maintain account security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Device List Display**: Users can view all devices connected to their account showing device name, type, last activity, location, and trust level with proper pagination for >10 devices. Verification: Test device list display with multiple registered devices, confirm pagination works correctly.
2. **Device Labeling**: Users can assign custom names to trusted devices and edit existing device labels through an intuitive form interface. Verification: Assign custom names to devices, edit existing labels, confirm changes persist.
3. **Remote Logout**: Users can remotely logout from specific devices with confirmation dialog showing device details and requiring explicit confirmation. Verification: Initiate remote logout, confirm dialog displays device details, verify logout effectiveness.
4. **Real-time Notifications**: Users receive push notifications within 5 seconds of new device login attempts with actionable options. Verification: Simulate new device login, confirm notification delivery within 5 seconds.
5. **Authentication Verification**: All device management actions require biometric or PIN verification before execution with fallback authentication options. Verification: Attempt device management actions, confirm biometric verification requirement.
6. **Device Fingerprinting**: System generates unique device fingerprints using hardware ID, IP address, browser fingerprint, and installation ID with collision resistance. Verification: Register multiple devices, confirm unique fingerprints are generated for each.
7. **Trust Scoring**: System calculates device trust scores (0-100) based on usage frequency, location consistency, and behavior patterns with daily updates. Verification: Monitor trust scores over time, confirm scoring algorithm responds to device behavior.
8. **Automatic Logout**: Devices automatically logout after 30 days of inactivity, with threshold configurable via admin settings and user notifications. Verification: Configure inactivity threshold, confirm automatic logout after specified period.
9. **Security Compliance**: System implements device management security best practices including encryption, audit logging, and access controls with GDPR compliance. Verification: Check audit logs for device management actions, confirm encryption implementation.
10. **Profile Integration**: Device management accessible through profile management interface from Story 1.7 with consistent navigation patterns. Verification: Access device management from profile interface, confirm navigation consistency.
