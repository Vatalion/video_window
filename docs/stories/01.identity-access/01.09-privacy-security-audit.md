# Implementation: Story 1.9 - Security Audit System Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, the session management from **Story 1.5**, and the device management system from **Story 1.8** to create a complete security ecosystem.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Authentication & Security System (PRD section: Security Audit Features) and enables comprehensive account security monitoring and audit logging with real-time threat detection and response capabilities.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing security incidents by 85% and maintaining 99.9% compliance with security regulations as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Security incident reduction: Reduce security threats by 85%
- Compliance adherence: Maintain 99.9% regulatory compliance
- Threat detection response time: <10 seconds for suspicious activity alerts
- Audit log completeness: 100% of security events logged with full metadata
- User security confidence: Improve security perception score by 80%

## Domain Context
**Security Audit System** refers to a comprehensive monitoring and logging system that tracks all account security events, detects suspicious behavior patterns, and provides real-time alerts to users and administrators.

**Anomaly Detection** is the process of identifying unusual patterns or outliers in user behavior that may indicate security threats or unauthorized access attempts.

**Risk Scoring** is a numerical assessment (0-100) of the potential security risk associated with a specific event or user activity, based on multiple factors and behavioral patterns.

**Account Lockout Protection** is a security mechanism that temporarily blocks user access after a specified number of failed authentication attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

## Technical Context
This story extends the security ecosystem built in previous stories (1.1, 1.5, 1.8) and will be implemented as a new feature module in `lib/features/security/` following the existing project architecture patterns with clean architecture (data, domain, presentation layers).

Key technical components:
- SecurityEventService in `lib/features/security/data/services/` for audit logging
- SecurityAuditLogModel in `lib/features/security/domain/models/` for data representation
- SecurityBloc in `lib/features/security/presentation/bloc/` for state management
- SecurityDashboard and SecurityEventList widgets in `lib/features/security/presentation/widgets/` for UI

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new security monitoring API endpoints and integrate with the notification system from Story 1.8.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Security Dashboard Navigation**: Swipe gestures to navigate between security event views, tap to expand event details
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Security action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Response Actions**: One-tap acknowledge/alert resolution with confirmation swipe gesture
- **Filter and Search**: Intuitive filtering of security events by date, type, risk level with search functionality

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Event Timeline View**: Visual timeline of security events with color-coded risk indicators
- **Real-time Alert Display**: Prominent display of new security alerts with actionable options
- **Risk Score Visualization**: Visual representation of risk scores with clear explanations
- **Account Health Summary**: At-a-glance account security status with recommendations

### Visual Design System
- **Security Status Indicators**: Color-coded security events (green for normal, yellow for medium risk, red for high risk)
- **Risk Level Icons**: Distinct icons for different types of security events (login, transaction, profile change)
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Modular dashboard components for security metrics and event monitoring
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for security-focused viewing sessions

## Story
**As a** security-conscious user and system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive account security monitoring and audit logging with real-time threat detection,
**so that** I can quickly identify and respond to suspicious activities while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete Security Event Logging**: All security events logged with user_id, event_type, timestamp, IP address, user_agent, device_id, risk_score, and event_details with proper indexing for search. Verification: Perform security events (login, profile change, transaction), confirm all metadata is logged correctly.
2. **Encrypted Log Storage**: Security audit logs stored with encryption at rest using industry-standard algorithms. Verification: Check log storage encryption implementation, verify logs cannot be read without decryption keys.
3. **Log Retention Management**: Configurable audit log retention policies with automatic cleanup (default: 90 days). Verification: Configure retention policies, confirm logs are automatically cleaned up after specified period.
4. **Comprehensive Log Search**: Users can search and filter audit logs by date range, event type, risk score, and device. Verification: Test log search functionality with various filter combinations, confirm accurate results.
5. **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: System detects and scores anomalous behavior patterns in real-time with <10 second response. Verification: Simulate anomalous behavior, confirm detection and scoring within 10 seconds.
6. **Multi-factor Risk Analysis**: Risk scoring considers location, device trust, time patterns, and frequency of events. Verification: Perform activities from different locations/devices, confirm risk scores adjust appropriately.
7. **Behavioral Pattern Learning**: System learns normal user patterns to improve detection accuracy over time. Verification: Monitor detection accuracy improvements over multiple user sessions.
8. **False Positive Reduction**: Detection algorithms minimize false positives while maintaining security sensitivity. Verification: Test normal user behavior patterns, confirm low false positive rate (<5%).
9. **Multi-channel Alerts**: Security events trigger immediate notifications via push notifications and email. Verification: Trigger security events, confirm notifications are sent via all configured channels.
10. **Regulatory Compliance**: System adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and financial industry security regulations. Verification: Review system implementation against regulatory requirements, confirm compliance measures.
