# Story 01.02: Social Authentication

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Identity & Access Foundation

## Story
As a returning or new user,
I want to sign in with my Google, Apple, or Facebook account with social warmth and instant engagement,
so that I can access the app quickly while seeing friends and relevant content immediately.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Social auth is treated as commodity connectors without social warmth or immediate engagement, resulting in missed network effects and lower activation rates.
- **Solution**: Implement social authentication with automatic profile hydration, friend discovery, and instant social proof to create addictive first-session experiences.
- **Impact**: Increase social auth adoption by 60%, improve D1 retention by 45%, and boost content engagement through immediate social connections by 70%.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user completes social authentication, **When** they enter the app, **Then** the system hydrates their profile with provider graph data, shows "friends on app" carousel (3-5 users) with explicit consent, and suggests creator affinity matches based on shared interests, driving first-session engagement by 50% with measurable time-to-first-interaction <30s.
- [ ] **Given** a user initiates social auth, **When** they select a provider, **Then** each provider (Google, Apple, Facebook) completes end-to-end auth in p50 < 3s with link rate > 70% on matching emails, with all latency instrumented with real-time monitoring and alerts for SLO breaches (p95 < 5s).
- [ ] **Given** a social auth attempt, **When** the system detects risk signals, **Then** it implements step-up verification (email/SMS/biometric) for risky signals (new device, geo anomaly, IP mismatch) with offline-friendly retry guidance and session preservation, maintaining <0.1% false positive rate.
- [ ] **Given** multiple social auth options, **When** a user views the auth screen, **Then** the system uses smart provider ordering based on device/platform and prior success rates, with privacy-first friend invite flows post-auth to drive network effects, achieving 25% increase in social connections.
- [ ] **Given** a provider outage or throttling, **When** auth fails, **Then** the system gracefully degrades to alternative auth methods with clear error messaging, exponential backoff, and session state preservation, maintaining 99.5% availability and <5s failover time.
- [ ] **Given** successful social authentication, **When** tokens need refresh, **Then** auth tokens refresh seamlessly with p95 < 500ms rotation time, maintaining cart/creation context through auth flows via signed deep links and local state persistence with 99.9% success rate.
- [ ] **Given** the social auth funnel, **When** users complete authentication, **Then** the system tracks D1 activation lift vs. email-only baseline, provider adoption rates, and auth funnel drop-offs with 5-10% holdout groups for A/B testing and copy optimization, measuring statistical significance >95%.
- [ ] **Given** any social auth path, **When** a user interacts with the flow, **Then** all paths support VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic text scaling, and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with empathetic error copy, achieving 100% accessibility audit pass rate.
- [ ] **Given** privacy regulations, **When** social data is accessed, **Then** the system implements GDPR/CCPA-compliant consent management, data minimization, and provides transparent privacy controls with opt-out capabilities, maintaining 100% compliance rate.
- [ ] **Given** network conditions, **When** connectivity is poor, **Then** social auth flow supports offline mode with cached provider selection and automatic retry logic, maintaining 90% completion rate even under 3G conditions.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Social auth adoption rate increase from 35% to 95%, D1 activation lift of 25% vs. email-only baseline, friend discovery rate >60% from social graphs, viral coefficient >0.4 from social invites
- **Technical Metric**: Provider auth completion time p50 < 3s, p95 < 5s; token refresh success rate > 99.5%; provider availability 99.9%; failover time <5s
- **User Metric**: Social connection completion rate >80%, user satisfaction score >4.7/5, support ticket reduction for auth issues by 65%, time-to-first-interaction <30s
- **Security Metric**: Account takeover prevention rate >99.9%, data privacy compliance 100%, fraud detection rate >95% with <0.1% false positive rate

## Technical Requirements
- Implement social auth integration using `google_sign_in`, `sign_in_with_apple`, and `flutter_facebook_auth` packages with unified error handling and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect compliance
- Build social graph hydration system with privacy-first friend discovery, consent management, and GDPR/CCPA-compliant data handling
- Deploy risk-based step-up verification system with device fingerprinting, anomaly detection, and machine learning-based risk scoring
- Configure smart provider prioritization engine with machine learning-based ordering optimization and A/B testing capabilities
- Implement resilient fallback mechanisms with circuit breaker patterns, exponential backoff, and automatic failover to alternative auth methods
- Build session continuity system with deep link preservation, context-aware state management, and offline support for poor network conditions
- Ensure cross-platform consistency with native platform integrations, haptic feedback, and platform-specific design patterns
- Deploy comprehensive security measures including token encryption, audit logging, and automated compliance monitoring

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: OAuth provider credentials and APIs, social graph APIs, risk scoring service, session management system, real-time analytics pipeline
- **Business**: Legal team for social data usage compliance and privacy regulations, marketing team for social referral assets, design team for social UX patterns, security team for threat modeling
- **Prerequisites**: Story 01.01 (User Registration) for base auth flows, Story 01.05 (Session Management) for token management, Story 01.09 (Privacy Security Audit) for compliance monitoring

## Out of Scope
- Multi-factor authentication setup during social auth (deferred to Story 01.03)
- Complex social graph analysis beyond immediate friend discovery and affinity matching
- Social media posting or content sharing during auth flows
- Advanced social preference settings during initial setup
- Integration with additional social providers beyond Google, Apple, and Facebook
- Social media feed integration within the authentication flow

## Dev Notes
- Social authentication serves as a critical growth lever for the Video Window platform, leveraging existing social networks to drive immediate engagement
- The "social warmth" approach focuses on making users feel immediately connected rather than treating social auth as purely functional
- Privacy-first friend discovery ensures compliance while maximizing network effects through explicit consent and transparency
- Risk-based step-up verification balances security with user experience, only adding friction when necessary based on comprehensive risk assessment
- Smart provider ordering optimizes conversion rates by learning from user behavior and platform-specific success patterns through machine learning
- The system must handle scale from 100 to 1M+ users with consistent performance and security posture across all providers
- Real-time monitoring and alerting ensure immediate detection and resolution of provider issues or performance degradation
