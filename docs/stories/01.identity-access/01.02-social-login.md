# 1.2 Social Media Authentication System

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Epic
User Authentication System (1.0) - Enable users to register and login to the application using multiple authentication methods to reduce friction during onboarding and improve user experience.

## Story
As a new or existing user,
I want to authenticate using social media providers (Google, Apple, Facebook),
so that I can quickly access the application without needing to remember additional credentials.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Social Button Placement**: Prominently display social login buttons above traditional login form
- **Consistent Sizing**: All social login buttons follow the same sizing and spacing guidelines
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear tap feedback with ripple effects or color changes on press
- **Accessibility Priority**: Social login buttons should be easily reachable and focusable

### Visual Design System
- **Brand-Aligned Buttons**: Social login buttons follow platform-specific design guidelines
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Distinguish between primary social login options and secondary actions
- **Error State Visualization**: Clear error indicators when social authentication fails
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during authentication process with spinners or progress indicators

### Platform-Specific UI Patterns
- **iOS Design Language**: Follow iOS human interface guidelines for Apple Sign In placement and styling
- **Android Material Design**: Use Material Design principles for all social login components
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified authentication experience across platforms with platform-specific nuances

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Google OAuth Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Google OAuth and create/access their account
2. **Apple Sign In Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Apple Sign In and create/access their account
3. **Facebook OAuth Integration**: Users can successfully authenticate using Facebook OAuth and create/access their account
4. **Account Creation/Linking**: Social authentication properly creates new accounts or links to existing user accounts
5. **Profile Data Import**: User profile information (name, email, profile picture) is automatically imported and saved from social accounts
6. **Multi-Account Linking**: Users can link multiple social accounts to a single user profile
7. **Coexistence with Email/Phone**: Social authentication works alongside existing email/phone registration without conflicts
8. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling provides clear feedback for failed social authentication attempts
9. **Account Unlinking**: Users can successfully unlink social accounts from their profile
10. **Platform Compliance**: All social authentication implementations comply with respective platform policies and security standards

- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria validated with clear pass/fail conditions

## Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Verify all social authentication flows work with real provider credentials
- [ ] Test secure token storage implementation across all supported platforms
- [ ] Validate account linking/unlinking functionality with edge cases
- [ ] Confirm performance benchmarks are met for all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance for all social login UI elements

## Security Review
- OAuth 2.0 implementation follows security best practices
- Tokens are securely stored using platform-specific secure storage
- CSRF protection implemented for OAuth flows
- Session management and token refresh mechanisms properly implemented
- Input validation and sanitization applied to social profile data

## Performance Considerations
- Authentication response times should be < 5 seconds
