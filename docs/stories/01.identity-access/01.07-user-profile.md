# Implementation: Story 1.7 - User Profile System

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, session management from **Story 1.5**, and account recovery system from **Story 1.6**.

## Business Context
This story establishes a comprehensive user profile management system that allows registered users to customize their account experience, control privacy settings, and manage their digital presence. The implementation builds upon the authentication foundation from Story 1.1 and integrates with device management from Story 1.8 for enhanced security. The profile system serves as a critical component for personalization across the application, supporting commerce features and user engagement through customizable notification preferences.

The feature directly supports business goals of increasing user engagement by 40% and improving personalization effectiveness by 65% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- User engagement rate: 40% increase through personalized content
- Profile completion rate: 75% of users complete profile information
- Data export requests: Support GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements
- Account deletion processing: 99% data removal within 24 hours

## Domain Context
**User Profile** refers to the collection of user-provided information that defines their identity and preferences within the application, including personal details, media, and settings.

**Profile Management** is the process of creating, updating, and maintaining user profile information while ensuring data integrity and security compliance.

**Privacy Controls** are user-configurable settings that determine how their personal information is shared and displayed within the application and to other users.

**Notification Preferences** are user-specific settings that control how and when they receive various types of notifications from the application.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1, builds upon session management from Story 1.5, and integrates with account recovery from Story 1.6. The profile management system will be implemented as a new `lib/features/profile/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- ProfileService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- PrivacyService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- NotificationService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- UserProfileModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- SocialLinkModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- PrivacySettingModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- NotificationPreferenceModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- ProfileBloc for state management in `lib/features/profile/presentation/bloc/`
- ProfileEditor UI component in `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/`
- ProfileImageUploader UI component in `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/`

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new profile-related API endpoints and integrate with AWS S3/CloudFront for media storage.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Profile Editing**: Swipe to edit sections, tap to expand detailed settings
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Profile action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Image Management**: Pinch to zoom, drag to reposition profile images
- **Privacy Controls**: Toggle switches for quick privacy setting changes

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Profile Editor View**: Tabbed interface for different profile sections (basic info, media, privacy, notifications)
- **Image Upload View**: Modal presentation for image selection and cropping
- **Privacy Settings View**: List-based interface with clear toggle controls
- **Notification Preferences View**: Grouped settings with descriptive labels

### Visual Design System
- **Profile Completion Indicators**: Progress bar showing profile completion status
- **Media Preview**: Consistent image display with aspect ratio preservation
- **Privacy Status Icons**: Clear visual indicators for privacy settings
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for extended viewing sessions
