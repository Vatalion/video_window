# Story 01.07: User Profile System

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Foundation

## Story
**As a** shopper or creator,
**I want** my profile to be a commerce hub with storefront highlights and personalization controls,
**so that** I can showcase my identity, drive engagement, and control how my data powers recommendations.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: User profiles are treated as static settings rather than commerce-first personas driving engagement and social connections.
- **Solution**: Transform profiles into dynamic commerce hubs with storefront integration, social features, and transparent personalization controls.
- **Impact**: Increase profile completion rate by 40%, boost social engagement through profiles by 60%, and improve recommendation effectiveness by 35%.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Commerce-First Profile Hub:** Profile surfaces creator storefront highlights, featured playlists, and saved items with tap-through rates > 15%; links directly to follow graph and notification settings for engagement loops.
2. **Auto-Hydration from Social Auth:** Profiles automatically populate with provider data (Google/Facebook/Apple) during social auth with user consent; progressive prompts collect additional preferences rather than long forms.
3. **Personalization Controls:** Clear toggle controls for data usage in recommendations with instant impact visibility; explain "how your data improves your experience" with concrete examples and opt-out options.
4. **Performance Metrics:** Profile completion rate > 70% by Day 7, storefront tap-through > 15%, conversion lift +5% from completed profiles; all metrics tracked with real-time dashboards.
5. **Badge System & Achievement:** Shopping streak badges, creator milestones, and profile completion rewards with visual indicators; nudge loops encourage profile enhancement with tangible benefits.
6. **Privacy Transparency:** Timeline of data usage, consent receipts, and one-tap data download/delete with SLAs; sentiment tracking builds trust through transparency.
7. **Cross-Device Profile Sync:** Profile changes sync across devices in real-time with conflict resolution; maintain shopping and creation context across sessions.
8. **Analytics Integration:** Profile interaction events (storefront taps, badge unlocks, setting changes) feed into recommendation algorithms and conversion attribution models.

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- Critical Issues impacting product impact
  - Profile framed as static settings; lacks shoppable persona surface (creator storefront, saved carts, badges) driving engagement.
  - Privacy/compliance strong but measurement of profile’s impact on recommendations and conversion is missing.
  - No warm-start hooks from social auth to prefill and seed profile for immediate value.
- Should-Fix to unblock
  - Elevate profile as a commerce hub: storefront module, featured playlists, saved items; link to follow graph and notifications.
  - Metrics: profile completion > 70% D7, storefront tap-through > 15%, conversion lift from completed profiles +5%.
  - Auto-hydrate from providers (Story 01.02) with consent; progressive prompts instead of long forms.
- Nice-to-Have (high leverage)
  - Badge system reflecting shopping streaks/creator milestones; nudge loops to complete profile.
- Final Assessment
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with commerce surfaces, measurement, and auto-hydration.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Story uses custom structure and lacks template-required sections (`Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records); acceptance criteria numbered but not linked to tasks.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Dev Notes absent; teams need authoritative guidance on data models, storage policies, and privacy compliance for profile data.
  - No testing plan covering profile edits, privacy toggles, data export/deletion SLAs, or notification preferences.
  - Profile story treats identity as static settings rather than commerce-first persona driving engagement.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria should include measurable targets (profile completion latency, export response time) and instrumentation ownership.
  - Tasks are broad and omit source tree references or integration sequencing with analytics, notifications, and KYC flows.
  - Security/compliance obligations (GDPR, data export) need explicit references and enforcement strategy.
  - Elevate profile to a shoppable hub with creator storefront highlights, mood badges, and personalization controls feeding recommendation loops.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Capture analytics for profile completion, privacy setting adoption, and notification opt-in impact.
  - Provide UX guidance on data export/deletion messaging and personalization highlights.
  - Define analytics for profile interaction events (storefront taps, badge unlocks) and cross-link to loyalty systems.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Claims about AWS S3/CloudFront integration and multi-service interactions require confirmation in architecture docs.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **5 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

  - Profile story treats identity as static settings rather than commerce-first persona driving engagement.
  - Elevate profile to a shoppable hub with creator storefront highlights, mood badges, and personalization controls feeding recommendation loops.
  - Define analytics for profile interaction events (storefront taps, badge unlocks) and cross-link to loyalty systems.
## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, session management from **Story 1.5**, and account recovery system from **Story 1.6**.

## Business Context
This story establishes a comprehensive user profile management system that allows registered users to customize their account experience, control privacy settings, and manage their digital presence. The implementation builds upon the authentication foundation from Story 1.1 and integrates with device management from Story 1.8 for enhanced security. The profile system serves as a critical component for personalization across the application, supporting commerce features and user engagement through customizable notification preferences.

The feature directly supports business goals of increasing user engagement by 40% and improving personalization effectiveness by 65% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- User engagement rate: 40% increase through personalized content
- Profile completion rate: 75% of users complete profile information
- Data export requests: Support GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements
- Account deletion processing: 99% data removal within 24 hours

## Domain Context
**User Profile** refers to the collection of user-provided information that defines their identity and preferences within the application, including personal details, media, and settings.

**Profile Management** is the process of creating, updating, and maintaining user profile information while ensuring data integrity and security compliance.

**Privacy Controls** are user-configurable settings that determine how their personal information is shared and displayed within the application and to other users.

**Notification Preferences** are user-specific settings that control how and when they receive various types of notifications from the application.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1, builds upon session management from Story 1.5, and integrates with account recovery from Story 1.6. The profile management system will be implemented as a new `lib/features/profile/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- ProfileService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- PrivacyService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- NotificationService in `lib/features/profile/data/services/`
- UserProfileModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- SocialLinkModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- PrivacySettingModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- NotificationPreferenceModel in `lib/features/profile/domain/models/`
- ProfileBloc for state management in `lib/features/profile/presentation/bloc/`
- ProfileEditor UI component in `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/`
- ProfileImageUploader UI component in `lib/features/profile/presentation/widgets/`

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new profile-related API endpoints and integrate with AWS S3/CloudFront for media storage.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Profile Editing**: Swipe to edit sections, tap to expand detailed settings
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Profile action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Image Management**: Pinch to zoom, drag to reposition profile images
- **Privacy Controls**: Toggle switches for quick privacy setting changes

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Profile Editor View**: Tabbed interface for different profile sections (basic info, media, privacy, notifications)
- **Image Upload View**: Modal presentation for image selection and cropping
- **Privacy Settings View**: List-based interface with clear toggle controls
- **Notification Preferences View**: Grouped settings with descriptive labels

### Visual Design System
- **Profile Completion Indicators**: Progress bar showing profile completion status
- **Media Preview**: Consistent image display with aspect ratio preservation
- **Privacy Status Icons**: Clear visual indicators for privacy settings
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for extended viewing sessions
