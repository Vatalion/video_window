# Implementation: Story 1.5 - Session Management and Token Refresh

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1** and the biometric authentication implemented in **Story 1.4**.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Authentication & Security System (PRD section: Session Management Features) and enables users to have seamless, secure session management that maintains their authentication state across app usage sessions while ensuring security through proper token lifecycle management.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing authentication friction by 60% while maintaining 99.9% security compliance as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Authentication friction reduction: 60% fewer login prompts
- Session security compliance: 99.9% adherence to JWT best practices
- Cross-device synchronization success rate: 99.5%
- Session timeout incidents reduction: 75% fewer forced logouts

## Domain Context
**Session Management** refers to the process of tracking and maintaining user authentication state across multiple interactions with an application. It involves creating, maintaining, and terminating user sessions securely.

**Token Refresh** is a security mechanism where short-lived access tokens are automatically renewed using long-lived refresh tokens, preventing the need for users to re-authenticate frequently while maintaining security.

**Cross-Device Synchronization** means maintaining consistent session state across multiple devices used by the same user, allowing seamless transitions between devices.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1 and integrates with the biometric authentication from Story 1.4. The session management system will be implemented within the existing `lib/features/auth/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- SessionManager service in `lib/features/auth/domain/services/`
- TokenRefresher middleware in `lib/features/auth/data/middleware/`
- Session UI components in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/`
- DeviceTrustManager in `lib/features/auth/domain/managers/`

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new session-related API endpoints.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Session Management Interface**: Swipe to revoke sessions, tap to view session details
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Session action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Security Actions**: One-tap session termination for suspicious activity
- **Biometric Integration**: Seamless transition between biometric authentication and session management

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Session List View**: Card-based layout for active sessions with device information
- **Session Detail View**: Modal presentation for session information and actions
- **Security Alerts**: Non-intrusive banners for session activity notifications
- **Device Trust UI**: Clear indicators for trusted vs untrusted devices

### Visual Design System
- **Security Status Indicators**: Color-coded session status (green for active, gray for expired, red for suspicious)
- **Device Icons**: Platform-specific icons for device recognition (iOS, Android, Web)
- **Session Activity Timeline**: Visual timeline of session activities with timestamps
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for extended viewing sessions

## Story
**As a** user of the application,
**I want** secure session management with automatic token refresh,
**so that** I can continue using the app without repeated logins while maintaining security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **JWT Token Management**: Access tokens are generated with configurable expiration (15-60 minutes) and stored securely in device keychain storage. Verification: Unit tests confirm token generation with proper expiration times and secure storage retrieval.
2. **Refresh Token System**: Refresh tokens (7-30 days) automatically renew access tokens before expiration without user interaction or app blocking. Verification: Integration tests simulate token expiration and verify automatic renewal without UI interruption.
3. **Session Tracking**: System tracks concurrent sessions across multiple devices with unique device identification and real-time status updates. Verification: Test multiple device connections and verify session tracking in the backend dashboard.
4. **Session Timeout**: User sessions automatically terminate after 30 minutes of inactivity with clear notification. Verification: Automated test simulates inactivity and confirms session termination with notification display.
5. **Session Revocation**: Administrators and users can revoke specific sessions or all sessions on demand with immediate effect. Verification: Test session revocation API endpoints and confirm immediate effect across all devices.
6. **Cross-Device Sync**: Session state synchronizes across user devices in real-time with conflict resolution. Verification: Test session state changes on one device and verify propagation to other devices within 5 seconds.
7. **Activity Monitoring**: System logs and monitors session activities for security analysis with detailed audit trail. Verification: Confirm audit logs contain session start/end times, IP addresses, and device information.
8. **Security Compliance**: All token operations follow OAuth 2.0 and JWT security best practices with RS256 signature algorithm. Verification: Security scan tools verify token handling compliance with industry standards.
9. **Device Recognition**: System identifies and remembers trusted devices for streamlined access with fingerprinting. Verification: Test device fingerprinting accuracy and verify trusted device list persistence.
10. **Termination Security**: All sessions are properly terminated and tokens invalidated on logout or revocation. Verification: Confirm tokens are removed from storage and backend records upon termination.
