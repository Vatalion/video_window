# Story 01.05: Session Management & Token Refresh

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Security

## Story
As a logged-in shopper or creator,
I want my sessions to persist securely across devices with commerce continuity and intelligent refresh,
so that I can maintain shopping carts, creator tools, and video progress without interruption while protecting my account.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Session management focuses on expiry mechanics rather than preserving critical commerce context across devices, leading to cart loss and creator workflow disruption.
- **Solution**: Implement intelligent session management that prioritizes commerce continuity while maintaining robust security through adaptive refresh and cross-device sync.
- **Impact**: Reduce cart abandonment by 30%, improve creator productivity by 25%, and enhance user trust through transparent session control.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user with active sessions, **When** they switch devices, **Then** sessions maintain shopping cart contents, creator tool states, and video progress across devices with signed deep links, enabling seamless resume within 2 seconds.
- [ ] **Given** active sessions, **When** tokens require refresh, **Then** token refresh success rate maintains > 99.5%, rotation failure rate < 0.2%, time-to-refresh p95 < 500ms with real-time alerts for SLO breaches.
- [ ] **Given** session lifecycle management, **When** monitoring security, **Then** access tokens refresh automatically via Serverpod 5 minutes before expiry, rotate refresh tokens every 24 hours, and revoke old tokens on rotation failure.
- [ ] **Given** credential storage requirements, **When** tokens are stored, **Then** refresh tokens store only in platform-secure storage (Keychain/Keystore), encrypt with flutter_secure_storage, and clear immediately on logout or device revocation.
- [ ] **Given** user inactivity, **When** idle timeout approaches, **Then** after 25 minutes the app displays a warning banner with one-tap reauth (biometric/MFA), at 30 minutes it soft-locks while preserving cart/creation state.
- [ ] **Given** new device login, **When** authentication occurs, **Then** existing sessions receive push/email notifications via FCM/SendGrid within 5 seconds and reflect the new device in the active session list.
- [ ] **Given** session revocation, **When** a user terminates a session, **Then** revoking a session terminates the target session in <2 seconds, invalidates tokens server-side, and preserves critical commerce state for recovery.
- [ ] **Given** risk detection, **When** suspicious activity occurs, **Then** risk signals trigger step-up verification per MFA story while keeping the original session suspended with commerce state pending success/failure.
- [ ] **Given** concurrent usage, **When** multiple devices access, **Then** the system enforces device-aware concurrency rules (1 TV + 1 phone + 1 tablet default) with educator-friendly overrides during events.
- [ ] **Given** session performance, **When** monitoring health, **Then** the system tracks session health metrics, drop-offs, refresh errors, and commerce impact with 5% holdout groups to measure continuity impact.

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Cart abandonment reduction of 30%, creator productivity improvement of 25%, cross-device session continuity rate of 90%
- **Technical Metric**: Token refresh success rate > 99.5%, refresh latency p95 < 500ms, session sync time < 2s, system availability 99.99%
- **User Metric**: Session continuity satisfaction score > 4.5/5, support ticket reduction for session issues by 60%, user trust score increase of 20%

## Technical Requirements
- Implement intelligent session orchestration using Riverpod with refresh cadence management and idle timers
- Deploy secure token storage with platform-secure storage and encryption-at-rest for refresh tokens
- Build commerce continuity system with deep link preservation and cross-device state synchronization
- Configure real-time session monitoring with WebSocket integration and push notification alerts
- Implement adaptive risk scoring with device fingerprinting and behavioral pattern analysis
- Develop concurrency management system with device-aware limits and educator override capabilities
- Ensure offline capability with session state persistence and conflict resolution on reconnect

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Serverpod backend integration, FCM/SendGrid notification services, secure storage system, risk scoring engine
- **Business**: UX team for session UX flows, security team for session policies, legal team for compliance requirements
- **Prerequisites**: Story 01.03 (Multi-Factor Authentication) for step-up verification, Story 01.08 (Device Management) for device awareness

## Out of Scope
- Advanced session analytics beyond basic health monitoring
- Complex session sharing between users beyond basic concurrency limits
- Session recording or playback capabilities
- Advanced session preference management beyond basic notification settings

## Notes
- Session management serves as the backbone for commerce continuity, ensuring that critical user context is never lost
- The intelligent refresh system balances security with user experience, only applying friction when necessary
- Cross-device sync enables users to seamlessly transition between devices while maintaining their workflow
- Risk-based session protection ensures that suspicious activity is flagged without disrupting legitimate usage
- Commerce context preservation is prioritized to prevent business impact from security measures
