# Story 01.06: Account Recovery

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic**: Identity & Access Security

## Story
**As a** shopper or creator who lost access,
**I want** an empathetic, secure recovery flow with guidance and anti-abuse protection,
**so that** I can regain my account quickly with minimal anxiety while preventing fraud.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Account recovery flows are procedural and anxiety-inducing, lacking empathy or reactivation hooks post-restore, leading to user abandonment and support burden.
- **Solution**: Implement empathetic recovery with risk-based routing, anti-abuse protection, and post-recovery reboarding that guides users back to value.
- **Impact**: Reduce recovery abandonment by 50%, improve recovery success rate by 40%, and enhance user trust through transparent security processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Empathy-First UX:** Recovery screens feature calm tone, step counters, inline device/location details, and "Need help?" callouts; plain-language error guidance reduces anxiety and builds trust throughout the process.
2. **Risk-Based Routing:** Dynamic step-up verification (backup codes, trusted contact approval links, biometric fallback) based on risk signals; channel fallback (email↔SMS) and safe rate limits prevent unnecessary friction for legitimate users.
3. **Anti-Abuse Protection:** Hash tokens with short TTL; implement device fingerprinting, geo-velocity checks, and reCAPTCHA/proof-of-human challenges for suspicious attempts; immediate session/token/biometric invalidation on successful recovery.
4. **Performance SLOs:** Recovery completion maintains p50 < 3 minutes, success rate > 85%, support deflection > 40%, false-positive step-ups < 3%; all metrics instrumented with real-time dashboards and alerting.
5. **Self-Service Security Center:** Users can review recovery attempts, lock/unlock accounts, and manage trusted contacts; timeline view with clear device/location details and one-tap "panic freeze" capability.
6. **Post-Recovery Reboarding:** Deep-link users to last cart/follow/creator dashboard; prompt to enable MFA/passkeys; offer optional notifications primer; track recovered revenue and re-engagement metrics.
7. **Measurement & Analytics:** Instrument recovery funnel with reason codes; include 5% holdout groups for copy/flow experiments; track sentiment, recovered revenue, and support ticket deflection rates.
8. **Compliance & Privacy:** Maintain GDPR/CCPA compliance with 12-month log retention and automated deletion workflows; sentiment-tracked recovery messaging templates with opt-out controls.

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- Critical Issues impacting product impact
  - Flow prioritizes procedure over reassurance and speed; lacks empathy-first copy, clear progress indicators, and a self-serve Security Center to review attempts and lock/unlock the account.
  - No risk-based routing: safe users face unnecessary friction, while risky signals don’t trigger appropriate step-up (extra factor, trusted contact) or channel fallback.
  - Anti-abuse gaps: weak velocity controls, no device fingerprinting/geo-velocity, and insufficient disposable email/VoIP filtering; support burden likely during promo spikes.
  - Trust rebuild and reactivation underplayed: post-recovery doesn’t guide users back to carts/follows or prompt strengthening security (MFA, passkeys).
  - Measurement is thin: no targets for time-to-recover, success rate, recovered revenue, or support deflection; no holdouts for copy/step experiments.
- Should-Fix to unblock
  - Empathy-first UX: calm tone, step counter, inline device/location details, “Need help?” callouts; plain-language error guidance.
  - Risk engine and routing: dynamic step-up (backup codes, trusted contact approval links, biometric fallback where enrolled), channel fallback (email↔SMS), and safe rate limits.
  - Security controls: hash tokens with short TTL; IP/device fingerprint and geo-velocity checks; reCAPTCHA/proof-of-human on suspicious attempts; immediate session/token/biometric invalidation on success.
  - Post-recovery reboarding: deep-link to last cart/follow/creator dashboard; prompt to enable MFA/passkeys; optional notifications primer.
  - Instrumentation & SLOs: p50 recovery < 3 minutes, success > 85%, support deflection > 40%, false-positive step-ups < 3%; dashboards for attempts, success, abuse patterns, recovered revenue.
- Nice-to-Have (high leverage)
  - One-tap “panic freeze” to lock account; passkey-based recovery for recognized devices; sentiment tracking of recovery copy; proactive tips to store backup codes safely.
- Final Assessment
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with risk-based flow + empathy + anti-abuse + reactivation + measurement in scope.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## Validation Result

**Quick Summary**
- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 7/10
- Major gaps: Align final recovery messaging templates with Brand/Legal and verify Serverpod recovery endpoints before implementation.
