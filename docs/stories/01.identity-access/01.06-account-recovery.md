# Implementation: Story 1.6 - Account Recovery System

## Status
Draft

## Priority
High

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation builds upon the user authentication system established in **Story 1.1**, two-factor authentication from **Story 1.3**, and session management implemented in **Story 1.5**.

## Business Context
This story addresses the critical need for users to recover account access when they forget passwords or lose authentication credentials. Building upon the authentication foundation established in Story 1.1, session management from Story 1.5, and 2FA capabilities from Story 1.3, this recovery system ensures users can regain access while maintaining robust security standards and preventing unauthorized account access attempts.

The feature directly supports the business goal of maintaining 99.9% account security while ensuring legitimate users can recover access with minimal friction. This directly impacts user retention metrics by reducing account lockouts by 85%.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Account recovery success rate: 95% of legitimate users can recover access
- Security incident reduction: 70% fewer unauthorized access attempts
- User support tickets: 60% reduction in password-related support requests
- Recovery time: 90% of users complete recovery within 5 minutes

## Domain Context
**Account Recovery** refers to the process of securely restoring user access to their account when they've lost or forgotten their authentication credentials. It involves verification of user identity through multiple channels before granting access.

**Password Reset** is a specific recovery mechanism where users receive a time-limited token to set a new password for their account, typically delivered via email or SMS.

**Multi-Step Verification** means requiring users to complete multiple identity verification steps before gaining access to sensitive account recovery functions, increasing security.

**Recovery Token** is a cryptographically secure, time-limited code that authorizes a user to perform account recovery operations, stored hashed in the database.

## Technical Context
This story extends the authentication system implemented in Story 1.1, builds upon 2FA from Story 1.3, and integrates with session management from Story 1.5. The recovery system will be implemented within the existing `lib/features/auth/` module structure, following the established layered architecture pattern (data, domain, presentation).

Key technical components:
- PasswordResetService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/`
- PhoneRecoveryService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/`
- BackupRecoveryService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/`
- RecoverySecurityService in `lib/features/auth/data/services/`
- RecoveryTokenModel in `lib/features/auth/domain/models/`
- SecurityQuestionModel in `lib/features/auth/domain/models/`
- RecoveryAttemptModel in `lib/features/auth/domain/models/`
- PasswordResetRequest UI component in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/`
- VerificationCodeInput UI component in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/`
- MultiStepRecoveryWizard UI component in `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/`

The implementation will use the existing Serverpod backend infrastructure with new recovery-related API endpoints and integrate with the BLoC pattern for state management.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Recovery Method Selection**: Tap to select recovery method, swipe to view additional options
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: Recovery action buttons positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Security Actions**: One-tap cancellation of recovery process if user didn't initiate it
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Step-by-step recovery wizard with clear navigation

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Recovery Request View**: Simple form for initiating recovery with email/phone input
- **Verification Code View**: Numeric keypad optimized for code entry with resend option
- **Security Question View**: Clear text input with visibility toggle for answers
- **Recovery Confirmation View**: Success screen with clear next steps

### Visual Design System
- **Security Status Indicators**: Color-coded verification status (blue for pending, green for verified, red for failed)
- **Recovery Method Icons**: Distinct icons for email, phone, and backup recovery methods
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress through multi-step recovery process
- **Dark Theme Support**: Consistent with app's dark theme for accessibility

## Story
**As a** user who has lost access to my account,
**I want** to securely recover my account through multiple verification methods,
**so that** I can regain access without compromising security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Email-Based Password Reset**: Users can successfully request password reset via registered email address. Verification: Test recovery flow with valid email and confirm reset email delivery within 30 seconds.
2. **Phone-Based Account Recovery**: Users can successfully request account recovery via registered phone number. Verification: Test recovery flow with valid phone number and confirm SMS delivery within 60 seconds.
3. **Token Expiration**: Password reset tokens expire after configurable time limit (default: 15 minutes). Verification: Initiate recovery, wait 15 minutes, verify token is no longer valid for password reset.
4. **Backup Recovery Methods**: Users can recover accounts using backup email or phone number when primary methods fail. Verification: Test recovery with backup methods and confirm successful account access restoration.
5. **Security Question Verification**: Multi-step recovery process requires security question verification for sensitive operations. Verification: Complete recovery flow requiring security questions and verify correct answers are required.
6. **Account Lockout Protection**: Account automatically locks after 5 failed recovery attempts within 15 minutes. Verification: Simulate 5 failed recovery attempts and confirm account lockout with unlock timer.
7. **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: System detects and blocks suspicious recovery patterns (multiple IPs, rapid attempts). Verification: Test recovery attempts from multiple IPs in rapid succession and confirm blocking.
8. **Security Notifications**: Users receive email/SMS notifications for all recovery attempts on their account. Verification: Initiate recovery and confirm notification sent to user's registered contact methods.
9. **Recovery Verification**: All recovery methods require verification and confirmation before completion. Verification: Test each recovery method and confirm verification step is required before account access restoration.
10. **Comprehensive Logging**: System logs all recovery attempts with IP address, user agent, and timestamp. Verification: Check recovery logs contain complete attempt information including IP, user agent, and timestamp.
