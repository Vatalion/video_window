# Story: API Authentication Framework

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive API authentication and authorization system with multiple authentication methods, role-based access control, and security monitoring.

## 2. Context
The API requires robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive user data and ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources. As a security engineer, I need to implement a comprehensive API authentication and authorization system so that I can ensure secure access to all API endpoints and protect user data from unauthorized access. This system must support multiple authentication methods (JWT, API keys, OAuth 2.0, session-based), implement proper session management, and include security monitoring capabilities while maintaining performance and usability.

## 3. Requirements
- **Authentication Methods**: Implement JWT authentication, API key authentication, OAuth 2.0 integration, and session-based authentication
- **Authentication Middleware**: Create authentication middleware with token validation, refresh mechanisms, and multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization System**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC), permission-based authorization, and policy-based authorization engine
- **Token Management**: Create JWT token generation/validation, token refresh/expiration handling, token revocation/blacklisting, and secure storage
- **Security Features**: Implement CSRF protection, secure HTTP headers, authentication endpoint rate limiting, and brute force protection
- **Session Management**: Create session tracking, concurrent session limits, session timeout handling, and session revocation capabilities
- **Security Monitoring**: Set up authentication event logging, suspicious activity detection, security alerts, and audit trails

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- JWT authentication works for all protected endpoints with proper token validation
- API key authentication is functional for service accounts with secure key management
- OAuth 2.0 integration supports third-party applications with proper token handling
- Role-based access control restricts access appropriately based on user permissions
- Token refresh mechanism works seamlessly without user interruption
- Security headers are properly configured (CSP, XSS protection, HSTS, etc.)
- Authentication failures are handled gracefully without information leakage
- Security events are logged and monitored with appropriate alerting
- Performance impact is minimal (< 10ms per request) under normal load
- All authentication methods work consistently across REST and GraphQL endpoints

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Security Standards**: Follow industry best practices and security standards (OWASP, NIST)
- **Token Management**: Use secure random number generation and proper cryptographic algorithms
- **Session Security**: Implement proper session lifecycle management with secure cookies
- **Error Handling**: Use generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant security regulations and standards
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive security testing including penetration testing
- **Monitoring**: Set up real-time monitoring for suspicious authentication activities
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear security documentation and best practices
