# Story 13.3: Delivery Confirmation Flow

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** buyer,
**I want** to confirm receipt of my order and provide feedback,
**so that** the transaction can be completed and the maker can be paid

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Buyer receives notification when package is delivered (carrier confirmation) with delivery timestamp, photo proof (if available), and confirmation prompt.
2. Buyer can mark order as received within app with optional rating/feedback and confirmation that item matches description and condition.
3. **BUSINESS CRITICAL**: Order auto-completes 7 days after delivery if no issues reported, triggering payment release to maker and closing transaction lifecycle.
4. Buyer can report delivery issues before auto-completion with issue categorization (not received, damaged, wrong item, quality issue) and evidence upload.
5. Maker receives notification when order is marked complete with buyer feedback, final payment release confirmation, and transaction summary.
6. **BUSINESS CRITICAL**: Payment is released to maker after completion confirmation via Stripe Connect transfer with 2-3 business day deposit timeline and fee deduction.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 13.2 – Tracking Integration System (delivery event tracking and status updates)
2. Story 12.1 – Stripe Checkout Integration (payment capture and Connect setup)
3. Story 11.1 – Notification System (delivery and completion notifications)
4. Story 13.4 – Shipping Issue Resolution (issue reporting and escalation workflow)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- This is the third story in Epic 13, completing the buyer side of the fulfillment lifecycle. It integrates with Story 13.2 (tracking events) and Story 13.4 (issue resolution) to ensure fair transaction completion and payment release.

### Data Models
- `Order` entity adds: delivered_at, confirmed_at, completed_at, payment_released_at, buyer_rating, buyer_feedback, completion_type (manual/auto). [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-13.md – Data Models]
- `PayoutRecord` entity: order_id, maker_id, gross_amount, platform_fee, stripe_fee, net_payout, stripe_transfer_id, released_at. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-13.md – Delivery Confirmation]
- Order status progression: delivered → confirmed/auto_completed → payment_released. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-13.md – Data Models]

### API Specifications
- `POST /orders/{id}/confirm-delivery` accepts buyer rating/feedback and transitions order to completed status. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-13.md – Delivery Confirmation]
- `POST /orders/{id}/release-payment` triggers Stripe Connect transfer with fee calculations and payout record creation.
- `GET /orders/pending-completion` returns delivered orders approaching auto-completion deadline for buyer reminder notifications.
- Stripe Connect Transfer API: Create transfer from platform account to maker Connect account with metadata and description.

### Component Specifications
- Delivery confirmation UI in `video_window_flutter/packages/features/commerce/lib/presentation/pages/delivery_confirmation_page.dart`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-13.md – Source Tree]
- Payment release service in `video_window_flutter/packages/core/lib/services/payments/payout_service.dart` handles Stripe Connect transfers.
- Server delivery endpoints in `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/orders/delivery.dart` manage confirmation and completion workflows.
- Scheduled job `auto_complete_delivered_orders` in `video_window_server/lib/src/jobs/` runs daily to process 7-day auto-completions.
- Integration with Stripe Connect for payment release (Epic 12 foundation) and issue resolution system (Story 13.4) for dispute handling.
