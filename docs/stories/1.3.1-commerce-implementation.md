## Testing Strategy

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: 100% coverage for media processing and optimization algorithms
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end media upload and processing workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Media optimization and CDN delivery performance
- **Security Testing**: File upload security and access control validation
- **User Experience Testing**: Media management interface usability

### Testing Framework
- **Flutter Testing**: `flutter_test` with `mocktail` for service mocking
- **Media Processing**: Custom media processing test suite
- **Integration Tests**: Serverpod client mocking for media endpoints
- **Performance Tests**: Media upload/download timing and optimization

### Test Scenarios
- Multi-format media upload (images, videos, 360° views)
- Image optimization and compression testing
- Video transcoding and streaming validation
- Media gallery management and organization
- Bulk media operations and performance
- Media versioning and rollback functionality

### Security Testing
- Malicious file upload prevention
- File type and size validation
- Media content sanitization
- Access control and permission testing
- CDN security and hotlinking prevention

### Performance Testing
- Large file upload performance
- Image optimization speed and quality
- Video transcoding performance
- CDN delivery speed and reliability
- Concurrent upload handling

## Success Metrics
- 100% test coverage for media processing components
- < 5 second image optimization processing time
- < 30 second video transcoding time (for 5-minute video)
- 99.9% media upload success rate
- Zero security vulnerabilities in media handling

## Technical Requirements
- Use FFmpeg for video processing
- Implement ImageMagick for image optimization
- Use AWS S3/CloudFront for storage and CDN
- Implement proper error handling for failed uploads
- Add progress tracking for large files

## Integration Points
