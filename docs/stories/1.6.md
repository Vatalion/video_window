# Story 1.6: Account Recovery System

## 1. Title
Implement a comprehensive account recovery system allowing users to securely regain access to their accounts through multiple recovery methods.

## 2. Context
This story addresses the critical need for users to recover account access when they forget passwords or lose authentication credentials. Building upon the authentication foundation established in Story 1.1, session management from Story 1.5, and 2FA capabilities from Story 1.3, this recovery system ensures users can regain access while maintaining robust security standards and preventing unauthorized account access attempts.

## 3. Requirements
**Validated by PO:** The following requirements have been confirmed and validated:

- **REQ-1**: Users must be able to initiate account recovery through multiple channels (email, phone, backup methods)
- **REQ-2**: All recovery tokens must be time-limited with configurable expiration periods
- **REQ-3**: System must support multi-step recovery processes with security question verification
- **REQ-4**: Recovery attempts must be monitored and tracked for security purposes
- **REQ-5**: Account lockout protection must be implemented to prevent brute force attacks
- **REQ-6**: Users must receive security notifications for all recovery attempts
- **REQ-7**: All recovery processes must comply with industry security best practices
- **REQ-8**: Recovery system must integrate with existing authentication and session management systems

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Verified by QA:** The following testable acceptance criteria ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **AC-1**: Users can successfully request password reset via registered email address
2. **AC-2**: Users can successfully request account recovery via registered phone number
3. **AC-3**: Password reset tokens expire after configurable time limit (default: 15 minutes)
4. **AC-4**: Users can recover accounts using backup email or phone number when primary methods fail
5. **AC-5**: Multi-step recovery process requires security question verification for sensitive operations
6. **AC-6**: Account automatically locks after 5 failed recovery attempts within 15 minutes
7. **AC-7**: System detects and blocks suspicious recovery patterns (multiple IPs, rapid attempts)
8. **AC-8**: Users receive email/SMS notifications for all recovery attempts on their account
9. **AC-9**: All recovery methods require verification and confirmation before completion
10. **AC-10**: System logs all recovery attempts with IP address, user agent, and timestamp

## 5. Process & Rules
**Enforced by SM:** The following workflow rules and naming conventions must be followed:

### Recovery Process Flow:
1. **Request Phase**: User selects recovery method and provides identifying information
2. **Verification Phase**: System validates user identity through selected method
3. **Security Phase**: Additional verification for sensitive operations (security questions)
4. **Recovery Phase**: User sets new credentials or completes recovery process
5. **Confirmation Phase**: System sends confirmation and invalidates existing sessions

### Naming Conventions:
- **File Naming**: Use `recovery_` prefix for all recovery-related files
- **Class Names**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `PasswordResetService`)
- **Method Names**: camelCase with action verbs (e.g., `sendRecoveryEmail`)
- **Variables**: camelCase with descriptive names (e.g., `recoveryTokenExpiresAt`)

### Security Rules:
- All recovery tokens must be generated using cryptographically secure random generators
- Recovery tokens must be hashed before storage in database
- Rate limiting must be applied to all recovery endpoints
- All recovery attempts must be logged with full context

## 8. Notes
**Additional information and clarifications:**

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- The recovery system must integrate with the existing Flutter architecture using BLoC pattern
- All recovery services must be implemented using dependency injection
- Recovery tokens must be stored using secure hashing algorithms (bcrypt recommended)
- Email delivery must use configurable SMTP settings with TLS encryption
- SMS delivery must support multiple providers with failover capabilities

- Recovery tokens should have a minimum length of 32 characters
- All recovery endpoints must implement rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Recovery attempts must be monitored for geographic anomalies
