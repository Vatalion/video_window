# Story 2.2: Verification Requirements within Publish Flow

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** creator attempting to publish a story,
**I want** to complete identity verification without leaving the publish wizard,
**so that** I can unlock publishing with minimal friction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a user without `can_publish` attempts to publish, the editor displays an inline verification card summarizing blockers and primary CTA. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#story-22-verification-within-publish-flow]
2. Launching Persona verification from the card opens hosted flow with proper branding, sends `capability_request_id`, and on completion resumes editor state. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#3-api-endpoints]
3. Persona webhook updates the associated `verification_task` and toggles `identityVerifiedAt` when approved; publish CTA enables immediately without re-authentication. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#story-22-verification-within-publish-flow]
4. Error states (verification rejected, timeout, or user cancels) display actionable messaging and allow retry. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#8-implementation-guide]
5. Analytics events `publish_verification_started` and `publish_verification_completed` include success/failure and verification duration. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#11-monitoring--analytics]

## Prerequisites
1. Story 2.1 – Capability Enablement Request Flow (capability requests and status polling)
2. Persona sandbox account configured with webhook secret and allowed redirect URIs
3. Story 1.3 – Session Management & Refresh (ensures webhook updates reflected in real time)

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Publish Flow Integration
- [ ] Add `PublishCapabilityCard` component gating publish CTA and showing requirements. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#7-source-tree--file-directives]
- [ ] Hook Persona deep link with in-app webview (Flutter `persona_flutter`). [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#story-22-verification-within-publish-flow]
- [ ] Persist draft context while verification session runs to avoid data loss.

### Serverpod Verification Pipeline
- [ ] Implement Persona webhook endpoint `POST /capabilities/tasks/{id}/complete` validating signature and status. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#31-request-payload-examples]
- [ ] Update `VerificationService` to map Persona outcomes to capability unlock logic (auto-approve when status == approved). [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#7-source-tree--file-directives]
- [ ] Emit audit event `verification.completed` with provider metadata, redacting PII. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#5-security--compliance-considerations]

### Client-Side State Updates
- [ ] Capability bloc listens to `capability.unlocked` events and re-renders publish CTA. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#1-architecture-overview]
- [ ] Handle rejection state by showing `Review Required` status and linking to support. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#1-architecture-overview]
- [ ] Add instrumentation for time-to-unlock metric.

### Testing & Monitoring
- [ ] Widget tests covering gating scenarios (not started, in progress, completed, rejected). [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#10-testing-strategy]
- [ ] Integration test verifying webhook triggers capability unlock and enables publish. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#9-acceptance-criteria-traceability]
- [ ] Dashboard chart for Persona success/reject rate, with alert on reject >5% hour-over-hour. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#11-monitoring--analytics]

### Navigation Shell Foundation (Merged from Core Platform Services 02.2)
- [ ] Implement typed route registry with Navigator 2.0/go_router covering feed, story detail, dashboard, settings, and capability center.
- [ ] Add auth + capability guards that preserve deep links and redirect unauthenticated users through sign-in before resuming.
- [ ] Instrument navigation observer to emit analytics events with previous route, trigger (in-app, deep link), and capability context.
- [ ] Provide not-found route and graceful error handling for malformed deep links, ensuring fallback navigation is available.

## Data Models
- `VerificationTask` records track provider, status, metadata, and link to capability. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#2-data-models]
- `UserCapabilities.identityVerifiedAt` timestamp indicates success and unblocks publish flow. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#2-data-models]

## API Specifications
- `POST /capabilities/request` called from publish flow to create capability request if none exists. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#3-api-endpoints]
- `POST /capabilities/tasks/{id}/complete` consumes Persona webhook payload to update verification status. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#31-request-payload-examples]

## Component Specifications
- UI components live under `video_window_flutter/packages/features/story_editor/lib/presentation/widgets/`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#7-source-tree--file-directives]
- Serverpod webhook handler located at `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/capabilities/capability_endpoint.dart`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#7-source-tree--file-directives]
- Verification service orchestrates provider calls within `video_window_server/lib/src/services/verification_service.dart`.

## Testing Requirements
- Persona sandbox flow covered end-to-end including manual approver scenario. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#10-testing-strategy]
- Automated tests assert CTA enables immediately after webhook completion without re-login. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#9-acceptance-criteria-traceability]
- Security tests cover webhook signature validation and replay detection. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#5-security--compliance-considerations]

## Technical Constraints
- Persona sessions must expire after 24 hours; stale requests prompt user to restart. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#5-security--compliance-considerations]
- Draft data must persist across verification attempts to avoid user frustration. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#8-implementation-guide]
- Webhook processing must be idempotent and safe to retry. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#5-security--compliance-considerations]
