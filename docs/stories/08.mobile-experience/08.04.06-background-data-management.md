# Energy-Aware Background Data Management for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience Optimization

## Story
As a video commerce user, I want my app to stay up-to-date with the latest products, prices, and creator content without draining my battery or using excessive data, so that I always have fresh shopping content when I open the app.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Aggressive background data usage drains battery and consumes data plans, leading to user frustration and app uninstalls
- **Solution**: Implement intelligent background data management with energy-aware scheduling, freshness priorities, and ROI optimization
- **Impact**: Reduce battery usage by 30%, decrease data plan overages by 25%, and improve user retention by 20%

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Background Data Management
- [ ] **Given** I am a shopper, **When** new drop launches occur, **Then** product information and pricing are updated silently in background with <3% battery impact and <10MB data usage
- [ ] **Given** I am following creators, **When** they publish new content, **Then** creator videos and live shopping schedules are pre-loaded during optimal charging/wifi conditions with 95% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I am on a limited data plan, **When** background updates occur, **Then** data usage is optimized by 40% through compression, delta sync, and intelligent scheduling
- [ ] **Given** my battery is below 20%, **When** background tasks are scheduled, **Then** non-essential updates are deferred until charging conditions are detected, with only critical updates (order status, security) allowed
- [ ] **Given** I have made recent purchases, **When** the app is backgrounded, **Then** order updates and delivery information are prioritized over other data syncs with <5 minute latency
- [ ] **Given** I am using cellular data, **When** background transfers occur, **Then** the system adapts transfer sizes and frequency to prevent plan overages, with daily caps and user notifications

### Advanced Sync & Freshness Management
- [ ] **Given** I am a frequent shopper, **When** I open the app, **Then** my personalized content is 95% fresh with <500ms loading time and cached metadata availability
- [ ] **Given** background data costs exceed conversion benefits, **When** ROI analysis runs, **Then** the system automatically adjusts data strategies to maintain positive value with real-time cost-benefit calculation
- [ ] **Given** multiple content types need updating, **When** background sync runs, **Then** the system prioritizes based on user behavior, conversion potential, and freshness requirements using a tiered priority system
- [ ] **Given** I am traveling or in low-connectivity areas, **When** background sync occurs, **Then** the system adapts sync frequency and data transfer size to maintain reliability without excessive battery drain

### User Control & Transparency
- [ ] **Given** I want to manage background data usage, **When** I access settings, **Then** I can see detailed usage statistics, set data caps, and configure sync preferences with immediate effect
- [ ] **Given** background sync fails, **When** retry mechanisms activate, **Then** the system provides user-facing notifications with clear error messaging and manual retry options
- [ ] **Given** I am concerned about privacy, **When** background data collection occurs, **Then** all data collection respects user preferences and provides clear opt-out controls with granular permissions
