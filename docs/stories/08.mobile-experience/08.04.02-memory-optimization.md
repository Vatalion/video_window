## Story
As a video commerce creator, I want to create and edit shoppable content without fear of losing my work to memory issues, so that I can confidently produce high-quality videos knowing my creative sessions are protected from background termination while maintaining optimal performance across all device types.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Memory crashes during video editing cause creator frustration, lost productivity, and content abandonment, resulting in 40% of creators abandoning sessions on low-end devices
- **Solution**: Implement intelligent memory management with tiered session protection, adaptive caching, automated recovery mechanisms, and real-time memory optimization
- **Impact**: Increase creator retention by 30%, reduce content abandonment by 40%, improve video completion rates by 25%, and enable creation on devices with 2GB RAM minimum

## Acceptance Criteria

### Memory Protection & Session Management
- [ ] **Given** I am editing a shoppable video on a device with <4GB RAM, **When** system memory exceeds 85% capacity, **Then** my active editing session is protected with 99.9% success rate through background process prioritization
- [ ] **Given** I am processing 4K product footage, **When** available memory drops below 500MB, **Then** the system automatically switches to 1080p proxy media within 2 seconds while preserving all edit decisions and timeline positioning
- [ ] **Given** I am creating content on a budget device (2GB RAM), **When** memory pressure reaches critical levels (>90%), **Then** non-critical cached content is evicted using LRU algorithm while maintaining creative work integrity with <100ms UI response time
- [ ] **Given** I experience an unexpected app termination due to memory pressure, **When** I restart the app, **Then** I can recover my complete editing session including timeline, effects, and product links within 10 seconds with 99.5% success rate

### Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] **Given** I am exporting a finished video, **When** background processes compete for memory, **Then** export operations maintain priority with <1% failure rate and automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Given** I am browsing product catalogs while editing, **When** memory becomes constrained (<300MB available), **Then** product browsing switches to lightweight mode with cached thumbnails while maintaining full editing functionality
- [ ] **Given** I am working on long-form content (>10 minutes), **When** memory usage approaches 80% of device capacity, **Then** the system provides progressive warnings at 70%, 80%, and 90% thresholds with actionable optimization options
- [ ] **Given** I am collaborating with other creators, **When** memory is limited (<400MB available), **Then** shared content and collaborative features remain available through intelligent cache compression and lazy loading

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** I am adding shoppable products to my video, **When** memory is constrained, **Then** product catalog access is optimized with progressive loading while maintaining product link integrity and pricing accuracy
- [ ] **Given** I am previewing my shoppable video, **When** memory pressure increases, **Then** preview quality adapts dynamically while maintaining interactive hotspots and product information visibility
