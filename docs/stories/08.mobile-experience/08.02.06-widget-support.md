# Shoppable Home Screen Widgets

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience - Widget Support

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues impacting product impact**
  - Widgets lack shoppable intent: no live countdowns, low-stock alerts, or buy-now actions; they risk becoming static info tiles.
  - Refresh strategy and deep links aren't aligned to commerce moments (price drops, restocks, live streams starting).
  - No personalization by user cohort or creator affinity; one-size-fits-all reduces engagement.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Define widget types: Creator Spotlight, Deal Countdown, Cart Reminder, and Live Now — each with deep links to exact in-app states.
  - Personalize data sources per user (followed creators, wishlist/cart, local timezone deal windows); safe fallbacks when data is stale.
  - Refresh policies within OS limits (timelines on iOS, WorkManager on Android) keyed to commerce events, not fixed intervals.
  - Instrument taps, impressions, and conversions; A/B test layouts and CTAs.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - Interactive widgets where supported; glanceable AR price tags or QR for cross-device handoff.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with shoppable widget types, event-driven refresh, and deep linking.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **3 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

## Story
As a social commerce shopper,
I want shoppable home screen widgets that show live deals, creator content, and cart reminders with one-tap purchase actions,
so that I can engage with commerce opportunities and creator content without opening the full app.
