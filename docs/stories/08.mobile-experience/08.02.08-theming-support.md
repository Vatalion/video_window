# Intelligent Theming System with Event-Driven Skins

## Status
**Status:** Enhanced Ready for Dev ✅
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience - Theming Support
**Readiness Score:** 9.5/10
**Enhanced by:** Senior Product Owner - UI/UX Design & Mobile Theming Systems

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues impacting product impact**
  - Theming is limited to system dark/light; misses event-driven skins that amplify live drops, seasonal campaigns, or creator takeovers.
  - No guaranteed accessibility (contrast, motion preferences) or auto-checks; risk of unreadable CTAs on commerce surfaces.
  - Personalization gaps: no alignment of theme accents to user's creator affinity or product colorways; low emotional resonance.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Introduce Theme Taxonomy: System (default), Event (campaign/live), Creator (lightweight accent), and Accessibility (high-contrast/large-text).
  - Enforce WCAG AA contrast for text/CTAs and respect OS motion/transparency settings; add automated lint/check on theme tokens.
  - Enable server-driven theme toggles with expiration windows for campaigns; gracefully fall back on unsupported devices.
  - Instrument theme-driven conversion lift (e.g., CTA visibility, add-to-cart) and A/B test event skins vs. baseline.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - Adaptive accent colors derived from hero product/creator palette with safeguards; micro-animations for limited-time offers respecting motion prefs.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with event skins + accessibility guarantees + measurement.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Theming is limited to dark mode and ignores event-driven skins or accessibility heuristics.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Add event skins, adaptive brand takeovers, and automatic contrast checks.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Track theming adoption and correlate with engagement spikes.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **3 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**
