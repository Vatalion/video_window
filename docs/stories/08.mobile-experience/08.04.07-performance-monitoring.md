# Real-Time Performance Monitoring for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience Optimization

## Story
As a video commerce shopper and creator, I want a consistently fast and responsive app experience that adapts to performance issues in real-time, so that I can shop and discover products without frustrating delays while creators can maintain seamless live shopping experiences.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Performance issues go undetected until they impact users, leading to lost sales, abandoned carts, damaged creator reputation, and decreased user trust
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive real-time monitoring with automated alerting, release gating, session replay, and social commerce-specific performance insights
- **Impact**: Reduce performance-related issues by 40%, increase conversion rates by 15%, improve user satisfaction by 25%, and protect creator revenue streams

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Monitoring Capabilities
- [ ] **Given** I am using the app, **When** performance degrades below SLA thresholds (app startup >2s, frame drops >5%, network latency >800ms), **Then** real-time alerts trigger automated optimizations within 2 minutes and I experience adaptive content delivery
- [ ] **Given** I am launching the app, **When** startup times exceed device-tier targets (high-end: 1.5s, mid-tier: 2.5s, low-end: 4s), **Then** the system automatically activates performance optimizations, alerts the development team, and provides me with a progress indicator
- [ ] **Given** I am shopping during peak hours, **When** conversion rates drop by more than 10% from baseline, **Then** performance monitoring correlates this with technical metrics (load times, errors, network conditions) to identify root causes and triggers automatic content delivery adjustments

### Social Commerce-Specific Monitoring
- [ ] **Given** I am watching a live shopping stream, **When** stream performance degrades (buffering >3s, resolution drops, sync issues), **Then** the system automatically adjusts stream quality, prioritizes audio continuity, and alerts the creator
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator hosting a live event, **When** performance issues are detected, **Then** I receive real-time alerts with specific metrics (viewer retention, stream quality, engagement impact) and optimization recommendations
- [ ] **Given** I am browsing shoppable content, **When** loading times increase beyond thresholds (product cards: 500ms, video thumbnails: 800ms), **Then** the system implements progressive loading, prioritizes above-the-fold content, and maintains shoppable functionality

### Intelligence and Automation
- [ ] **Given** I experience performance issues, **When** problems occur, **Then** the system captures session replay data for analysis while respecting privacy preferences and providing me with a "Performance Mode" option
- [ ] **Given** I am on a specific device tier, **When** performance issues are detected, **Then** the system provides device-specific insights, optimization recommendations, and adaptive UI adjustments
- [ ] **Given** a new app version is released, **When** performance regression is detected (>10% degradation in key metrics), **Then** the system automatically blocks or pauses the rollout until issues are resolved and implements canary testing

### Critical Commerce Protection
- [ ] **Given** I am making a purchase, **When** checkout performance degrades, **Then** the system prioritizes checkout functionality, provides alternative payment options, and maintains cart state integrity
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator uploading content, **When** upload performance issues occur, **Then** the system implements resumable uploads, progress preservation, and backup mechanisms
