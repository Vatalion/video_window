# Intelligent Crash Recovery & Analytics for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** Critical
**Epic:** Mobile Experience Optimization

## Story
As a video commerce user, I want the app to intelligently detect, recover from, and learn from crashes with empathy and precision, so that I can trust the app to handle issues professionally while maintaining my shopping progress, creative work, and social interactions without data loss or frustration.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Crashes during shopping, content creation, and live events cause user trust erosion, abandoned carts (35%+ loss rate), creator frustration (40% work loss), and damaged brand reputation
- **Solution**: Implement AI-powered crash detection with intelligent recovery, personalized trust-building communication, commerce-prioritized data protection, and predictive stability analytics
- **Impact**: Reduce user churn by 40%, increase crash recovery success by 95%, maintain conversion rates post-crash, and protect creator revenue streams

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Recovery Scenarios
- [ ] **Given** I experience a crash during shopping, **When** I restart the app, **Then** I receive an empathetic apology with my shopping cart and progress restored within 8 seconds (95% success rate)
- [ ] **Given** I am a creator during video editing, **When** a crash occurs, **Then** my creative work is auto-saved every 30 seconds and I receive immediate recovery options with 99% success rate
- [ ] **Given** I am checking out, **When** the app crashes, **Then** my transaction progress is preserved and I receive priority recovery with compensation offer if appropriate (sub-30-second recovery)
- [ ] **Given** I experience multiple crashes within a session, **When** the app stabilizes, **Then** I receive personalized trust-building communication and compensation for my inconvenience
- [ ] **Given** I am uploading content, **When** a crash interrupts the process, **Then** my upload resumes automatically and I receive progress notifications
- [ ] **Given** I am in a live shopping event, **When** a crash occurs, **Then** I receive priority reconnection with event context preserved and viewer recovery

### System Intelligence & Analytics
- [ ] **Given** crashes occur in production, **When** patterns are detected, **Then** the system automatically identifies regressive builds and prioritizes commerce-impact issues with 95% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** crash rates exceed thresholds (0.5% sessions), **When** releases are deployed, **Then** the system automatically triggers rollbacks or staged rollout pauses
- [ ] **Given** crash data is collected, **When** patterns emerge, **Then** predictive analytics identify at-risk user segments and proactively stabilize their experience
- [ ] **Given** I opt-in to feedback, **When** crashes occur, **Then** I receive follow-up surveys to improve my experience and rebuild trust
- [ ] **Given** crash analytics are available, **When** reviewing dashboard, **Then** I see commerce-impact prioritization (revenue lost, users affected, creator impact)

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Given** the system detects a crash, **When** analyzing root cause, **Then** it categorizes crashes by commerce impact (transactional, creative, social, browsing) with 90% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** crash data is processed, **When** generating insights, **Then** the system provides actionable recommendations for stability improvements
- [ ] **Given** multiple devices are involved, **When** cross-device analysis occurs, **Then** the system identifies device-specific patterns and optimizes accordingly
- [ ] **Given** privacy regulations apply, **When** handling crash data, **Then** all data is anonymized and handled with appropriate consent mechanisms

### Architecture Pattern
```dart
// Core Architecture
class CrashManager {
  final CrashDetectionService _detection;
  final RecoveryService _recovery;
  final AnalyticsService _analytics;
  final TrustBuildingService _trustBuilder;
}

// State Management
abstract class CrashState {}
class CrashInitialState extends CrashState {}
class CrashDetectedState extends CrashState {
  final CrashData crashData;
}
class RecoveryInProgressState extends CrashState {
  final double progress;
}
class RecoveryCompletedState extends CrashState {
  final RecoveryResult result;
}
```

### Key Implementation Components

#### Crash Detection
```dart
class CrashDetectionService {
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    // Initialize Sentry and Firebase
    await SentryFlutter.init(
      (options) => options
        ..dsn = 'your-dsn'
        ..beforeSend = _beforeSend
        ..tracesSampleRate = 1.0
    );

    // Set up Flutter error handling
    FlutterError.onError = _handleFlutterError;
    PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = _handlePlatformError;
  }
}
```

#### Recovery Service
```dart
class RecoveryService {
  Future<RecoveryResult> recoverFromCrash(CrashData crash) async {
    // Classify crash by commerce impact
    final impact = await _classifyCommerceImpact(crash);

    // Prioritize recovery based on impact
    switch (impact.type) {
      case CommerceImpactType.transactional:
        return await _recoverTransaction(crash);
      case CommerceImpactType.creative:
        return await _recoverCreativeWork(crash);
      case CommerceImpactType.social:
        return await _recoverSocialState(crash);
      default:
        return await _recoverGeneralState(crash);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Analytics Integration
```dart
class CrashAnalyticsService {
  void trackCrashEvent(CrashData crash) {
    FirebaseAnalytics().logEvent(
      name: 'app_crash',
      parameters: {
        'crash_type': crash.type.toString(),
        'commerce_impact': crash.commerceImpact.toString(),
        'recovery_success': crash.recoverySuccessful,
        'user_segment': crash.userSegment,
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Implementation

#### iOS Integration
```dart
// iOS AppDelegate
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                   didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Initialize crash reporting
    FirebaseApp.configure()

    // Set up crash handling
    Crashlytics.crashlytics().setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true)

    return true
  }
}
```

#### Android Integration
```dart
// Android Application
class MainApplication : FlutterApplication(), PluginRegistry.PluginRegistrantCallback {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    // Initialize Firebase
    FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this)

    // Set up crash reporting
    FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(true)
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

test('Crash detection correctly classifies crashes', () async {
  final crashManager = CrashManagerMock();
  final result = await crashManager.detectAndClassifyCrash(testCrashData);

  expect(result.type, equals(CrashType.memory));
  expect(result.commerceImpact, equals(CommerceImpactType.high));
});

// Integration Tests
test('Full recovery flow maintains data integrity', () async {
  final recoveryService = RecoveryService();
  final originalState = createTestShoppingState();

  await recoveryService.saveState(originalState);
  final recoveredState = await recoveryService.recoverState();

  expect(recoveredState, equals(originalState));
});
