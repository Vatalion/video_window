# Gesture-Commerce Motion Sensor Integration for Shopping

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Device Access

## Story
As a social commerce shopper, I want intuitive gesture controls with privacy-protected motion sensors, so that I can browse products, add to wishlist, and interact with content through natural movements that make shopping more engaging and accessible while enabling creators to design interactive gesture-based shopping experiences.

## Business Value
