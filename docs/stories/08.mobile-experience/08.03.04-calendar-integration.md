# Social Commerce Calendar Integration for Live Events

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Device Access

## Story
As a social commerce shopper, I want to sync live shopping events and creator premieres to my calendar with RSVP tracking, so that I never miss exclusive drops, get timely reminders with inventory alerts, and receive personalized re-engagement for missed events.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Calendar integration lacks commerce-specific event types, RSVP funnels, and attribution tracking, missing opportunities to drive attendance and sales from scheduled events.
- **Solution**: Commerce-focused calendar integration with live event types, RSVP tracking, inventory-aware reminders, and attribution modeling that converts calendar events into sales.
- **Impact**: Increase event attendance by 45%, improve conversion from RSVP to purchase by 30%, and reduce no-show rates through targeted re-engagement.

## Acceptance Criteria
