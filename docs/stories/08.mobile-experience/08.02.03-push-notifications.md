# Intelligent Push Notification System

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience - Push Notifications

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)

### Critical Issues impacting product impact
- The current plan underplays real-time, behavior-driven, shoppable moments. Notifications must be ranked and timed to pull users back into the exact video/product context with a single tap.
- No fatigue controls or quiet hours defined; risk of churn via spammy feel.
- Lacks conversion-centric taxonomy (Marketing vs Commerce vs Transactional) and platform-specific delivery semantics (iOS interruption levels, Android channels with importance).
- Missing end-to-end attribution and holdout testing; cannot prove ROI or optimize.

### Should-Fix to unblock
- Introduce a Notification Orchestrator (backend) with: candidate generation, per-user scoring, rate limiting, deduplication, and timezone-aware scheduling.
- Define notification taxonomy, interactive actions, deep links into exact in-app states, and per-user preference center with granular toggles.
- Add analytics primitives (impression, open, action, dismiss, mute, convert) + commerce KPIs; implement experimentation (A/B + 5% global holdout).
- Implement platform semantics: iOS interruptionLevel/relevanceScore; Android channels (Marketing/Commerce/Transactional/Urgent) with importance.

### Nice-to-Have (high leverage)
- Predictive send-time modeling, creator-personalized templates, and "Remind me" snooze flows for price drops/restocks/live events.
- Draft risk scoring (fatigue/ROI) before launch.

### Final Assessment
- Decision: Conditional GO â€” proceed with orchestrator, taxonomy, guardrails, and analytics in scope.
- Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
- Confidence Level: Medium


## Story
