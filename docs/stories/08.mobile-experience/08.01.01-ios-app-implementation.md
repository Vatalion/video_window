# Flutter iOS App Implementation Details

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Experience

## Story
As a Flutter mobile developer, I need to implement the iOS-specific components and platform integrations for the Video Window app so that users can experience native iOS performance and features while maintaining Flutter's cross-platform benefits and social commerce capabilities.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: iOS users expect native performance and device integration, but pure Flutter apps can miss platform-specific optimizations and social engagement features
- **Solution**: Flutter app with strategic native iOS platform channels and plugins that deliver native experience while maintaining code sharing
- **Impact**: 30% improvement in user engagement, 20% increase in conversion rates from iOS-specific features, and reduced development overhead through shared codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
### Core Performance & Functionality
- [ ] **Given** the Flutter app is running on iOS 16.0+ devices, **when** users interact with shoppable video content, **then** native iOS performance optimizations achieve <100ms touch response time with sustained 60fps video playback across iPhone 12+ models, with graceful degradation maintaining >30fps on iPhone XR/XS
- [ ] **Given** a live shopping event is active, **when** users have the app installed, **then** Live Activities display real-time countdowns and product availability with 95% notification delivery accuracy and <500ms update latency
- [ ] **Given** users want to shop together, **when** they initiate SharePlay sessions via FaceTime, **then** shared shopping carts sync in real-time with <500ms latency achieving 85% session completion rate and automatic session recovery on network interruptions
- [ ] **Given** content creators share products, **when** users tap on shoppable overlays, **then** haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation with native iOS vibration patterns (CoreHaptics) achieving 99% user satisfaction and device-specific intensity optimization
- [ ] **Given** users need to authenticate, **when** they use biometric authentication, **then** Face ID/Touch ID integration achieves <1s authentication time with 98% success rate and fallback to passcode for authentication failures
- [ ] **Given** users come from social media, **when** they click deep links, **then** universal links route directly to shoppable content with commerce context preserved achieving 90% conversion rate and proper attribution tracking
- [ ] **Given** the app requires tracking permissions, **when** ATT prompts display, **then** 75% of users opt-in for personalized shopping experiences with clear value proposition and privacy manifest compliance

### Device Integration & Native Features
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** users receive push notifications, **then** notifications respect Focus modes, Scheduled Summary, and deliver at optimal times based on user behavior patterns
- [ ] **Given** users have enabled iCloud sync, **when** they switch between iOS devices, **then** shopping carts, preferences, and session state sync seamlessly with CloudKit integration achieving 95% sync success rate
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS 17.0+, **when** users interact with the app, **then** widgets display real-time product availability and live event countdowns with background refresh every 15 minutes
- [ ] **Given** users are in low connectivity areas, **when** they use the app, **then** core commerce functionality remains available with offline mode support and automatic sync when connectivity resumes
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** system dark mode or increased contrast is enabled, **then** the UI automatically adapts with proper color contrast ratios (>4.5:1) and maintains visual hierarchy
- [ ] **Given** users have accessibility needs, **when** they use VoiceOver, Switch Control, or Dynamic Type, **then** all commerce interactions are fully accessible with proper labels and navigation
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** users receive location permissions, **then** location-based commerce features activate with precise location accuracy (<50m) for geo-fenced shopping experiences
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** users experience app crashes or freezes, **then** automatic crash reporting captures stack traces and user context with 99% report delivery rate
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** battery level drops below 20%, **then** background processing and animations are optimized to extend battery life by 30% during commerce sessions
- [ ] **Given** the app is running on iOS, **when** users switch between cellular and WiFi, **then** video quality automatically adjusts maintaining smooth playback with adaptive bitrate streaming
