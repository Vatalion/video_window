# Commerce-Focused Biometric Authentication for Mobile Shopping

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Device Access

## Story
As a mobile commerce shopper, I want biometric authentication for purchase confirmations and sensitive actions with shared-device safety, so that I can complete transactions quickly and securely while protecting my account on shared or family devices.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Basic biometric authentication lacks commerce-specific use cases, shared-device protections, and telemetry optimization, leading to security concerns and checkout friction.
- **Solution**: Commerce-focused biometric authentication with sensitive action protection, shared-device safety features, and performance optimization that reduces friction while maintaining security.
- **Impact**: Increase conversion rates by 15%, reduce checkout abandonment by 25%, and enhance security for sensitive commerce actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** shared devices, **when** multiple users, **then** system implements session scoping, quick-lock UI, and secondary PIN for sensitive actions with 95% user comprehension
- [ ] **Given** saved payment methods, **when** reused, **then** system implements re-authentication windows (5-15 minutes based on risk) that balance security and convenience
- [ ] **Given** cross-platform usage, **when** switching devices, **then** system provides consistent biometric experience across iOS (Face ID/Touch ID) and Android (fingerprint/face unlock) with native platform integration
- [ ] **Given** accessibility needs, **when** biometric interaction, **then** system supports VoiceOver/TalkBack, dynamic text scaling, and haptic feedback with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] **Given** authentication attempts, **when** performance measured, **then** system captures latency, success/failure rates, and opt-out patterns with 99% accuracy and real-time dashboard
- [ ] **Given** biometric implementation, **when** effectiveness tracking, **then** system measures conversion lift, abandonment reduction, and user satisfaction with A/B testing framework (5% holdout group)
- [ ] **Given** security events, **when** monitoring active, **then** system logs all authentication attempts, security incidents, and compliance metrics with 99.99% data integrity
