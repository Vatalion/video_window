# Shoppable Camera Implementation with Commerce-Aware Capture

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience

## Story
As a Flutter developer, I need to implement a commerce-aware camera system with real-time product detection, session resilience, and conversion analytics, so that creators can reliably capture shoppable content that drives measurable business impact.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Generic camera implementations fail to support commerce workflows, lack session resilience, and don't track business impact. This leads to creator frustration, content loss, and inability to measure social commerce effectiveness.
- **Solution**: Commerce-aware camera with automatic product tagging, crash recovery, integrated conversion analytics, and social sharing capabilities that enable creators to reliably produce and distribute engaging shoppable content.
- **Impact**: Prevents creator content loss (>95% recovery rate), enables measurement of capture-to-publish funnel (>30% conversion), supports scalable commerce operations, and boosts community engagement through integrated social features (>20% engagement lift).
