# Signature Commerce Haptic Feedback for Brand Experience

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** Medium | **Epic:** Mobile Device Access

## Story
As a video commerce shopper, I want distinctive haptic feedback that reinforces key shopping moments, so that I can feel tactile confirmation for purchases, drops, and interactions that enhance my shopping experience and create brand recall.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Generic haptic feedback lacks commerce-specific patterns, brand differentiation, and measurable impact on user behavior and conversion rates.
- **Solution**: Signature haptic patterns for key shopping moments with A/B testing framework and device optimization that creates memorable brand experiences and drives engagement.
- **Impact**: Increase conversion rates by 8%, improve brand recall by 25%, and enhance user satisfaction through multi-sensory shopping experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** key shopping moments, **when** interactions occur, **then** system delivers signature haptic patterns for add-to-cart, purchase confirmation, live drop countdown, and creator shoutouts with 95% consistency across all supported devices
- [ ] **Given** haptic feedback, **when** triggered, **then** patterns synchronize with audio/visual cues for multi-sensory commerce experiences with <50ms timing accuracy and <10ms drift tolerance
- [ ] **Given** accessibility needs, **when** settings adjusted, **then** system respects OS motion reduction settings and provides in-app haptic intensity controls with 100% compliance, including granular intensity levels (0-100%) and pattern customization
- [ ] **Given** haptic implementation, **when** measured, **then** A/B testing framework quantifies impact on engagement and conversion rates with 90% statistical significance and real-time analytics integration
- [ ] **Given** different devices, **when** haptics play, **then** system optimizes patterns for iOS (Core Haptics) and Android (VibrationEffect) with platform-specific fallbacks and device capability detection
- [ ] **Given** battery constraints, **when** haptics triggered, **then** system implements intensity caps and usage limits with battery-conscious design patterns and intelligent power management
- [ ] **Given** purchase interactions, **when** user hesitates, **then** optional heartbeat pulse on Buy Now hover encourages purchase decisions with A/B tested effectiveness and user preference tracking
- [ ] **Given** haptic pattern library, **when** accessed, **then** system provides 15+ distinct commerce-specific patterns with configurable parameters for intensity, duration, and waveform characteristics
- [ ] **Given** multiple simultaneous haptic requests, **when** conflicts occur, **then** priority system resolves conflicts based on commerce context with purchase confirmations taking precedence over UI feedback
- [ ] **Given** haptic feedback system, **when** device enters low power mode, **then** system automatically reduces haptic intensity and frequency while preserving critical commerce interactions
- [ ] **Given** haptic playback, **when** interrupted by system events, **then** system gracefully resumes or replays critical patterns based on commerce context and user behavior analysis
- [ ] **Given** haptic system initialization, **when** device capabilities detected, **then** system automatically configures optimal haptic parameters for specific hardware with <5ms calibration time
