# Native iOS App Implementation for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Experience | **Quality Score:** 9.8/10

## Story
As a video commerce creator or shopper, I want a seamless iOS app experience with shoppable overlays, live commerce features, and native device integrations, so that I can create and shop content with delightful performance and native iOS capabilities while participating in the social commerce ecosystem through intuitive touch interactions and Apple ecosystem integration.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Users expect native iOS performance and features for video commerce, but current web experience lacks device integration, social engagement capabilities, and Apple ecosystem advantages that drive premium user experiences and higher conversion rates
- **Solution**: Flutter-based iOS app with native integrations, social commerce features, habit-forming UX patterns optimized for video shopping, and Apple ecosystem advantages including Face ID, SharePlay, and Live Activities
- **Impact**: 40% increase in user retention, 25% lift in commerce conversion rates, 20% increase in average order value from iOS users, and establishment of iOS as primary commerce channel with 4.5+ App Store rating

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** the iOS app is installed on iPhone 12+ (iOS 16.0+), **when** a user launches it, **then** the app achieves <2s cold start time with first shoppable video ready in 1s, achieving 95% launch success rate across all supported iPhone models (XR, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
- [ ] **Given** a user is browsing the video feed on iOS, **when** they scroll through content, **then** they experience 60fps performance with smooth commerce gesture recognition (pull-to-shop, 3D touch/force touch preview, pinch-to-zoom product details) with <100ms touch response time and <16ms frame rendering time
- [ ] **Given** a live shopping event is scheduled, **when** a user has the app installed, **then** they receive Live Activities notifications with dynamic countdowns and product availability updates achieving 85% notification open rate and 95% Live Activities accuracy
- [ ] **Given** multiple users want to shop together on iOS 16.1+, **when** they initiate a co-shopping session, **then** SharePlay integration enables shared product cart with real-time sync (<500ms latency) achieving 90% session completion rate and supporting up to 32 simultaneous participants
- [ ] **Given** a creator shares content from social media, **when** a user clicks the deep link, **then** they land directly on shoppable content with commerce intent preserved achieving 80% conversion from social referrals and supporting Universal Links for seamless app-to-app transitions
- [ ] **Given** the app needs user tracking permissions on iOS 14+, **when** first launched, **then** ATT prompts display with clear commerce value proposition achieving 70% opt-in rate for personalization while maintaining full functionality for opt-out users
- [ ] **Given** a user is watching shoppable video on iOS, **when** they interact with products, **then** haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation using Core Haptics with commerce-specific patterns (purchase success, add to cart, out of stock) achieving 99% crash-free rate and 95% user satisfaction

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 40% D1 retention rate, 25% commerce conversion lift, 15% increase in average order value from iOS users, 30% improvement in creator engagement on iOS
- **Technical Metric**: <2s cold start time, 60fps sustained performance, <1% crash rate, 95% successful deep link conversion, <500ms Live Activities update latency, <100ms touch response time
- **User Metric**: 85% notification engagement rate, 70% social sharing rate, 4.5+ App Store rating, 80% D7 retention rate, 90% user satisfaction with iOS-specific features

## Technical Requirements
- **Flutter Architecture**: Use Flutter 3.16+ with native iOS shell for shared business logic via `flutter_modular` package, supporting iOS 16.0+ minimum deployment target
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement `cached_network_image` for video thumbnails with intelligent caching strategies, `video_player` with hardware acceleration and pre-fetching, `flutter_bloc` for efficient state management, and `flutter_isolate` for background processing

- **Native iOS Features**:
  - `flutter_local_notifications` with Live Activities support (iOS 16.1+) for dynamic shopping events
  - `share_plus` for SharePlay integration enabling co-shopping sessions
  - `local_auth` for Face ID/Touch ID biometric authentication
  - `haptic_feedback` with Core Haptics for commerce interactions
  - `app_tracking_transparency` for ATT compliance
  - `device_info_plus` for device-specific optimizations
- **Video & Media**: `video_player` with AVPlayer integration, `camera` plugin for content creation, `image_picker` for photo library access, and `flutter_ffmpeg` for video processing
- **Device Optimization**: Dynamic Type support, Dark Mode integration, Adaptive UI for iPhone/ iPad split view, PIP (Picture-in-Picture) support for video content, and optimization for ProMotion displays
- **Compliance**: Privacy manifests for App Store review, ATT implementation with configurable messaging, GDPR/CCPA compliance, COPPA compliance for younger users, and Apple Pay integration
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: `firebase_analytics` for funnel tracking, `sentry_flutter` for crash reporting, `firebase_performance` for performance monitoring, custom events for commerce metrics, and iOS-specific Health app integration for wellness features

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Flutter 3.16+, iOS 16.0+ minimum deployment target, Xcode 15+, App Store Connect setup, Firebase project configuration, Apple Developer Enterprise account, TestFlight beta testing setup
- **Business**: App Store review approval (with privacy nutrition labels), payment processor integration (Apple Pay, Stripe), creator community onboarding, App Store optimization (ASO) for video commerce keywords
- **Prerequisites**: Core Flutter app architecture, backend commerce APIs with iOS-specific endpoints, authentication system with biometric support, video processing infrastructure with iOS optimization, content delivery network with edge caching
- **Integration Points**: iOS HealthKit for wellness features, Core Motion for gesture recognition, Core Haptics for feedback, AVFoundation for video processing, StoreKit for in-app purchases, CloudKit for user data synchronization

## Out of Scope
- Native Swift/SwiftUI development outside of Flutter platform channels (maintain Flutter-first approach)
- iPad-specific optimizations beyond responsive design and split-view support
- Apple Watch companion app and watchOS integration
- Mac Catalyst desktop app and macOS-specific features
- Advanced AR features beyond basic camera integration and ARKit face tracking
- Custom iOS widgets beyond standard Flutter widget implementations
- SiriKit integration and voice commands
- HomeKit integration for smart home features
- CarPlay integration for in-car experiences
