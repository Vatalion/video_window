# Background Processing

## Story Description
As a mobile app developer, I need to implement background processing so that the app can perform tasks like data synchronization, content updates, and maintenance operations while the app is not actively in use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement background task scheduling and execution
- [ ] Support background data synchronization
- [ ] Create background content download and processing
- [ ] Implement background location updates when applicable
- [ ] Support background push notification handling
- [ ] Include background task prioritization and queuing
- [ ] Implement background task timeout and retry logic
- [ ] Add background battery optimization
- [ ] Include background task analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Support background task cancellation and management

## Technical Specifications
- Use Background Tasks framework for iOS
- Use WorkManager for Android background processing
- Implement proper background task constraints (network, battery, charging)
- Support background task chaining and dependencies
- Include proper background task error handling
- Implement background task persistence and recovery
- Support background task scheduling and recurrence
- Include proper background task resource management
- Implement background task testing and debugging tools

## Dependencies
- Background processing frameworks and libraries
- Network connectivity and battery management
- Data storage and synchronization systems
- Task scheduling and queuing systems
- Analytics and monitoring systems

## Notes
- Consider platform limitations on background processing
- Plan for battery optimization and user experience
- Include proper background task security
- Consider background task compliance requirements
- Include proper background task fallback strategies
