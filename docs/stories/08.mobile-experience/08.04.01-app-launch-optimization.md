# Lightning-Fast App Launch with Shoppable Content

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience Optimization

## Story
As a video commerce shopper, I want the app to launch instantly with my personalized shoppable feed ready to interact, so that I can immediately start discovering and purchasing products without waiting for content to load.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Slow app launches cause user abandonment, with 40% of users abandoning apps that take longer than 3 seconds to load, and 53% abandoning if load time exceeds 5 seconds
- **Solution**: Optimize app launch sequence with shoppable content prefetching, adaptive loading paths, device-tier specific optimization, and performance guardrails
- **Impact**: Reduce user abandonment by 35%, increase daily active users by 20%, improve first-purchase conversion by 15%, and boost creator content engagement by 25%

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I am opening the Video Window app, **When** the splash screen appears, **Then** I reach my personalized shoppable feed within 2 seconds (p50) with hero video ready to play and 95% reliability across all device tiers
- [ ] **Given** I am a returning user, **When** the app launches, **Then** my recently viewed products, creator recommendations, and shopping cart items are pre-loaded and ready to tap within 1.5 seconds with sub-100ms gesture response
- [ ] **Given** I am on a mobile network (4G/5G), **When** the app launches, **Then** critical shoppable content loads first with non-essential features deferred until after first interaction using progressive loading
- [ ] **Given** I am using a budget device (2GB RAM or less), **When** the app opens, **Then** I experience an optimized lightweight version that maintains core shopping functionality with <1.8s launch time and memory usage <40% of available RAM
- [ ] **Given** I am tapping on products quickly, **When** the app is loading, **Then** my gestures are recognized and responsive within 800ms of first interaction with visual feedback on every tap
- [ ] **Given** performance issues occur in production, **When** launch times exceed thresholds, **Then** the system automatically triggers performance optimizations and rollback mechanisms within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Given** I am browsing creator content, **When** the app launches, **Then** live shopping schedules, new creator videos, and community trending items are prominently displayed and ready to watch within 1.2s
- [ ] **Given** I have poor network connectivity (<3G), **When** the app launches, **Then** I see cached content with clear network status indicators and graceful degradation maintaining core shopping functionality
- [ ] **Given** I am a frequent shopper with purchase history, **When** the app launches, **Then** I see personalized product recommendations and targeted creator content based on my shopping behavior within 1s
- [ ] **Given** I am in a live shopping event, **When** I relaunch the app, **Then** I'm immediately returned to the live stream with purchase options available within 1.5s including cart state preservation
- [ ] **Given** I am a new user, **When** the app launches for the first time, **Then** I see trending creator content and popular products within 2.5s with onboarding deferred until after engagement
- [ ] **Given** battery optimization is active, **When** the app launches, **Then** power consumption is minimized by limiting background updates and using cached content while maintaining core functionality

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: Increase user retention rate by 25%, reduce app abandonment rate by 35%, boost average session duration by 30%, and increase creator content views by 25%
- **Technical Metric**: Achieve cold start <2s (p50), warm start <800ms, time-to-first-gesture <800ms, first playable video <1s with 95% reliability, and memory usage <50MB baseline
- **User Metric**: Improve user satisfaction score to >4.4/5 for launch experience, increase daily session starts by 20%, reduce bounce rate by 40%, and achieve 90% user perceived performance rating

## Technical Requirements
- **Launch Targets**: Cold start <2s (p50), warm start <800ms, time-to-interactive <1.2s, first contentful paint <500ms, memory baseline <50MB, battery consumption <5% per hour
- **Shoppable Prefetch Pipeline**: Hero video segments (first 30 seconds), personalized product recommendations (top 10), creator content thumbnails, real-time pricing data, inventory status, and user shopping cart state
- **Adaptive Loading System**: Device-tier specific initialization (high/mid/low-end), network-aware content loading (5G/4G/3G/offline), progressive feature activation, and intelligent resource management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time launch time tracking with 100ms granularity, device tier segmentation, automated alerting on performance degradation, and CI/CD performance budget enforcement
- **Flutter Implementation**: Use flutter_bloc for efficient state management, hive for local caching (encryption support), flutter_isolate for background processing, and native platform channels for performance optimization
- **Social Commerce Integration**: Prefetch live shopping schedules, creator recommendations, community trending items, social proof elements (purchase counts, reviews), and personalized content based on user behavior
- **Performance Guardrails**: Automated performance budget checks, rollback mechanisms on SLA breach, A/B testing framework for optimization, and real-time performance telemetry

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Device Tier Classification
- **High-End Devices** (4GB+ RAM): Full feature set, HD video prefetch, advanced animations, complete personalization
- **Mid-Range Devices** (2-4GB RAM): Balanced features, SD video prefetch, simplified animations, core personalization
- **Budget Devices** (<2GB RAM): Essential shopping features only, thumbnail prefetch, minimal animations, basic personalization

### Network-Aware Loading
- **5G/Excellent WiFi**: Full content prefetch, HD video, real-time updates
- **4G/Good WiFi**: Partial prefetch, SD video, delayed updates
- **3G/Weak WiFi**: Essential content only, thumbnails, offline-first approach
- **Offline**: Cached content only, limited functionality, sync when reconnected

### Progressive Loading Sequence
1. **Critical Path (0-500ms)**: App shell, navigation, cached content display
2. **Core Features (500-1000ms)**: Shopping feed, product cards, basic interactions
3. **Enhanced Features (1000-2000ms)**: Personalization, recommendations, social features
4. **Deferred Features (2000ms+)**: Analytics, background sync, non-critical updates

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- **Launch Time Testing**: Measure cold/warm start times across device tiers
- **Memory Usage Testing**: Monitor memory consumption and garbage collection
- **Battery Impact Testing**: Measure battery drain during launch and idle periods
- **Network Condition Testing**: Test launch performance under various network conditions
- **Concurrency Testing**: Verify performance when multiple apps are running

### User Experience Testing
- **Perceived Performance Testing**: User perception of launch speed and responsiveness
- **Gesture Response Testing**: Measure tap/scroll response times during launch
- **Visual Feedback Testing**: Ensure proper loading states and progress indicators
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Handle network failures, low memory, and other edge cases
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify launch experience works with assistive technologies

### Integration Testing
- **Social Commerce Integration**: Verify creator content loading and live shopping features
- **Personalization Integration**: Test recommendation engine integration and user data loading
- **Payment Integration**: Ensure cart persistence and payment system availability
- **Analytics Integration**: Verify performance tracking and user behavior monitoring

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Device classification system, performance monitoring SDK, CDN configuration, content delivery APIs, Flutter packages (flutter_bloc, hive, flutter_isolate)
- **Business**: Product recommendation engine, creator content pipeline, inventory management system, pricing service, live shopping platform
- **Prerequisites**: Core app architecture, authentication system, shoppable video player, network optimization layer, caching infrastructure

## Out of Scope
- Complete app redesign or UI overhaul
- Backend API performance optimization (separate story)
- Network infrastructure improvements
- New feature development unrelated to launch performance
- Device hardware optimization or manufacturer-specific tuning
- Operating system-level modifications
