# Shoppable Video Performance Optimization

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Mobile Experience Optimization

## Story
As a video commerce shopper, I want instant app launches with shoppable content ready to engage, so that I can seamlessly browse and purchase products without any performance friction or waiting.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Slow app launches and shoppable content loading cause user abandonment and lost sales opportunities, with 40% of users abandoning apps that take longer than 3 seconds to load
- **Solution**: Optimize the critical path for shoppable video commerce with intelligent prefetching, adaptive loading strategies, and performance guardrails
- **Impact**: Increase user retention by 25%, boost conversion rates by 15%, reduce bounce rates by 30%, and improve creator content engagement by 20%

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** I am a new user opening the app, **When** the splash screen displays, **Then** the app loads in under 2 seconds (p50) with shoppable product metadata pre-cached
- [ ] **Given** I am scrolling through the shopping feed, **When** I pause on a product video, **Then** the video starts playing within 500ms with interactive shoppable elements available
- [ ] **Given** I am using a low-end device, **When** the app launches, **Then** I experience a lightweight shell version that maintains core shopping functionality with <1.5s launch time

### Performance Monitoring and Guardrails
- [ ] **Given** performance degrades in production, **When** SLA thresholds are breached, **Then** the system automatically triggers rollback within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Given** the app is experiencing performance issues, **When** CPU usage exceeds 80% for 30 seconds, **Then** the system automatically reduces non-critical animations and effects
- [ ] **Given** memory usage approaches device limits, **When** available memory falls below 20%, **Then** the system implements automatic cache cleanup and memory optimization
- [ ] **Given** performance monitoring detects issues, **When** metrics show degradation, **Then** detailed telemetry data is captured for performance analysis

### Social Commerce Performance
- [ ] **Given** I am a frequent shopper, **When** I open the app, **Then** my personalized feed and recently viewed products are pre-loaded and ready to interact within 1.2 seconds
- [ ] **Given** I follow specific creators, **When** the app launches, **Then** their latest content and live shopping schedules are prioritized and ready to view
- [ ] **Given** I am browsing shoppable content, **When** products are displayed, **Then** product cards load instantly with current pricing and inventory status
- [ ] **Given** live shopping events are active, **When** I open the app, **Then** active live streams are prominently displayed with participant counts and product highlights

### Network and Device Adaptation
- [ ] **Given** network conditions are poor, **When** the app launches, **Then** I see optimized content with graceful degradation maintaining core shopping functionality
- [ ] **Given** I am on a metered connection, **When** the app launches, **Then** data usage is optimized through adaptive quality settings and compressed content
- [ ] **Given** I am switching between network types, **When** connectivity changes, **Then** the app seamlessly adapts loading strategies without interrupting my shopping experience
- [ ] **Given** my device is low on battery, **When** the app is running, **Then** performance optimizations reduce battery consumption while maintaining core functionality
