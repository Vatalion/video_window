# Deep Linking and App Indexing

## Story Description
As a mobile developer, I need to implement deep linking and app indexing so that users can navigate directly to specific content within the app from external sources and search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement iOS universal links for web-to-app navigation
- [ ] Implement Android App Links for web-to-app navigation
- [ ] Set up proper URL schemes for custom deep linking
- [ ] Configure Firebase Dynamic Links for cross-platform deep linking
- [ ] Implement proper deep link routing within the app
- [ ] Set up app indexing for Google search
- [ ] Configure Apple Search API integration
- [ ] Implement proper deep link fallback handling
- [ ] Set up deep link analytics and tracking
- [ ] Test deep links across various contexts (email, SMS, web, social media)

## Technical Specifications
- Use branch.io or Firebase Dynamic Links for link management
- Implement proper deep link validation and security
- Configure domain ownership verification
- Set up proper link routing and navigation handling
- Implement proper deep link parameter parsing
- Configure link expiration and custom metadata
- Set up proper deep link testing and debugging tools
- Implement proper error handling for invalid deep links

## Dependencies
- Native iOS and Android apps
- Domain ownership and SSL certificates
- Firebase/branch.io account configuration
- App store and web app integration
- Analytics and tracking systems

## Notes
- Consider security implications of deep linking
- Plan for link migration and backward compatibility
- Include proper deep link documentation
- Consider privacy implications of deep link tracking
- Plan for internationalization of deep links
