## Technical Requirements
- **Flutter Build Pipeline**: Use Codemagic or GitHub Actions for automated Flutter builds with `flutter build apk` and `flutter build ipa`, implementing parallel build strategies for iOS and Android with cache optimization
- **App Store Integration**: `fastlane` for App Store Connect and Google Play Console automation with proper signing and provisioning, including automated metadata management and screenshot deployment
- **Deployment Automation**: Implement feature flags using `flutter_feature_flags` for progressive rollouts and A/B testing, with real-time configuration updates and segment-based targeting
- **Compliance Management**: Automated privacy policy generation using `flutter_privacy_policy`, age rating configuration, payment processing compliance for both platforms, and regional regulation tracking (GDPR, CCPA, COPPA)
- **Monitoring Integration**: `sentry_flutter` for crash reporting, `firebase_analytics` for release metrics, `flutter_performance` for deployment health monitoring, and custom real-time dashboards
- **Social Commerce Coordination**: Creator notification system using `firebase_cloud_messaging`, early access programs with `flutter_auth` custom claims, and coordinated launch campaigns with viral sharing mechanisms
- **Release Management**: Automated release notes generation, changelog management, and version tracking with `flutter_version` integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms, circuit breakers for store API failures, and graceful degradation for partial deployment failures

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Flutter 3.16+, Codemagic/GitHub Actions setup, App Store Connect/Google Play Console access with API keys, Firebase project with cloud messaging, SSL certificates for code signing, secure storage for secrets, CI/CD infrastructure with build agents
- **Business**: Legal team for compliance review across all regions, marketing team for launch coordination and campaign management, creator community management platform, customer support team trained on deployment issues
- **Prerequisites**: Core Flutter app development completed, payment processing integration with compliance validation, user authentication system with social login, analytics framework implementation, crash reporting system, feature flag infrastructure
- **Integration Points**: API connections to App Store Connect and Google Play Console, webhooks for deployment status, integration with existing CI/CD pipeline, connection to creator management system, integration with customer support platform

## Out of Scope
- Windows or macOS app store deployment
- Enterprise app distribution (MDM solutions)
- Third-party app store deployments (Amazon Appstore, etc.)
- App store optimization (ASO) consulting services
- Paid user acquisition campaigns

## Edge Cases and Error Handling
- **Build Failures**: Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff, detailed error logging, and automated alerting to development team
- **Store API Outages**: Circuit breaker pattern implementation, cached deployment states, and graceful degradation with manual override capabilities
- **Compliance Rejections**: Automated pre-flight checks, validation against store guidelines, and detailed rejection analysis with remediation suggestions
- **Rollback Scenarios**: Multi-stage rollback capabilities, data consistency checks, and user communication templates for rollback situations
- **Network Issues**: Offline deployment queue management, bandwidth optimization for large builds, and resumable upload capabilities
- **Security Incidents**: Immediate deployment pause, automatic security scan integration, and incident response workflows for compromised builds

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: 95% code coverage for deployment pipeline components, including build automation, compliance checks, and monitoring systems
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end deployment scenarios covering all store platforms, rollback procedures, and monitoring integrations
