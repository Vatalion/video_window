# Offline-First Social Commerce Architecture

## Status
**Status:** Enhanced for Development
**Priority:** Critical
**Epic:** Mobile Experience - Offline-First Architecture

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Offline mode ensures basic content visibility but not shoppable continuity: no offline cart/checkout, queued purchases, or "buy later" reservation; impulse buys are lost if connectivity drops.
  - No personalized prefetch strategy (next N shoppable videos + product metadata, price/stock snapshot); cache may be irrelevant to the next session.
  - Missing conflict-resolution UX for orders, cart merges, coupon expirations, and price/stock changes upon reconnection.
  - Unclear offline UX: lack of optimistic UI, pending badges, retry controls, and "notify me when back online" actions.
  - Weak privacy/storage guardrails (TTL, quotas, DRM/rights, encrypted-at-rest) and no user controls for battery/data usage.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Define an Offline Policy: what to cache (videos/covers, product cards, creator avatars), TTLs, size ceilings, eviction strategy; honor content rights/availability.
  - Personalized Prefetch: background prefetch of next-session queue driven by ranking (followed creators, in-progress videos, cart/wishlist focus) including product details and a price/stock snapshot.
  - Shoppable Continuity: offline action queue for likes/follows/comments/saves, add-to-cart, wishlist, and "Buy Now (pending)" with explicit confirmation on reconnect.
  - Sync/Conflict Strategy: server-authoritative reconciliation with user-friendly prompts when price/stock/coupon changed; item-level status chips and retry options.
  - UX/Feedback: global offline banner, disabled states with tooltips, pending indicators, "Remind me" and "Auto-complete on reconnect."
  - Background Sync Triggers: connectivity regain, app foreground, OS-appropriate periodic sync with exponential backoff; Wi-Fi-only toggle and per-quota caps.
  - Telemetry: offline session starts, actions queued, actions flushed, failures, reconciliation outcomes; alert on stuck queues.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - Download-for-trip (user-selected playlists or carts), low-data mode, and on-device recs fallback.
  - Adaptive prefetch that expands on Wi-Fi and shrinks on cellular/battery-saver.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO â€” proceed if shoppable continuity (queue + reconciliation) and personalized prefetch are in scope.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## Story
As a social commerce shopper,
I want to browse creator content, add products to cart, and queue purchases when offline,
so that I never miss shopping opportunities and can complete transactions when connectivity returns.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional offline modes only show content but lose commerce opportunities and user actions
- **Solution**: Intelligent offline caching with shoppable continuity, personalized prefetch, and seamless reconciliation
- **Impact**: 30% increase in conversion recovery, 25% reduction in cart abandonment, and enhanced user trust in offline shopping

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user is browsing creator content, **When** they go offline, **Then** they can continue viewing cached videos and product cards with 95% content availability
- [ ] **Given** a user is offline, **When** they add items to cart, **Then** the system queues these actions with optimistic UI and syncs when connectivity returns with 99% success rate
- [ ] **Given** the app is online, **When** background prefetch runs, **Then** it downloads personalized content (followed creators, wishlist items) with intelligent ranking and 500MB storage limit
- [ ] **Given** a user queues a purchase offline, **When** they reconnect, **Then** the system reconciles price/stock changes with user-friendly prompts and 90% resolution success
- [ ] **Given** the app is offline, **When** users interact with commerce features, **Then** they see clear offline indicators, pending badges, and "Remind me" options
- [ ] **Given** connectivity is restored, **When** the app detects it, **Then** it automatically syncs queued actions with exponential backoff and Wi-Fi preference settings
- [ ] **Given** offline actions are queued, **When** conflicts occur during sync, **Then** the system provides item-level status chips and retry options for resolution
- [ ] **Given** offline usage occurs, **When** analytics processes it, **Then** it tracks offline sessions, queued actions, and reconciliation outcomes with 99% data accuracy
- [ ] **Given** storage limits are approached, **When** eviction occurs, **Then** the system prioritizes high-value content (followed creators, cart items) with proper TTL management
- [ ] **Given** battery/data constraints, **When** prefetch runs, **Then** it respects user preferences (Wi-Fi-only, battery-saver mode) with adaptive throttling

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 30% increase in recovered conversions from offline-sourced actions and 25% reduction in cart abandonment
- **Technical Metric**: 95% offline content availability with <100ms local response time and 99% sync success rate
- **User Metric**: 85% user satisfaction with offline experience and <5% user-reported sync issues

## Technical Requirements
- **Flutter Implementation**: Use hive for local caching, connectivity_plus for network detection, and workmanager for background sync
- **Storage Management**: Implement SQLite with 500MB default limit, TTL-based eviction, and encrypted storage for sensitive data
- **Synchronization**: Delta sync algorithms with conflict resolution, exponential backoff, and queue prioritization
- **Performance**: <100ms local response time, background sync with <5% battery impact, and intelligent prefetch based on user behavior
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for cached data, secure storage of payment info, and proper DRM for content rights
- **Analytics**: Track offline sessions, queued actions, sync success/failure, and reconciliation outcomes

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Flutter local storage packages, connectivity detection, background task scheduling, conflict resolution algorithms
- **Business**: Content rights management, product data contracts, creator content availability policies
- **Prerequisites**: User authentication system, commerce platform integration, analytics infrastructure

## Out of Scope
- Full offline video streaming (thumbnails and previews only)
- Advanced offline recommendation algorithms beyond basic prefetch
- Complex multi-device offline synchronization scenarios
- Offline payment processing (queue for later processing only)
- Advanced DRM management beyond basic content protection

## Notes
- **Shoppable Continuity**: Critical to preserve all user actions (likes, follows, cart additions) for later sync
- **Personalized Prefetch**: Must prioritize content based on user's behavior patterns and relationships
- **Conflict Resolution**: User-friendly prompts for price/stock changes with clear resolution options
- **Battery/Data Optimization**: Respect user preferences and system constraints for background operations
- **Storage Management**: Intelligent eviction that preserves high-value content and respects device limits
- **Privacy First**: All cached data must follow privacy regulations with proper consent and data handling
