# Caching Strategies

## Story Description
As a mobile app developer, I need to implement comprehensive caching strategies so that the app can provide fast response times, reduce network usage, and work efficiently in offline scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement multi-level caching architecture
- [ ] Support memory caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Include disk caching for persistent data storage
- [ ] Implement network response caching and validation
- [ ] Support cache invalidation and cleanup strategies
- [ ] Add cache size management and quota control
- [ ] Include cache performance monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Implement cache encryption and security
- [ ] Support cache synchronization and conflict resolution
- [ ] Include cache performance testing and validation

## Technical Specifications
- Use caching frameworks and libraries
- Implement proper caching algorithms (LRU, LFU, etc.)
- Support cache key generation and management
- Include proper cache expiration and invalidation
- Implement cache compression and optimization
- Support cache performance monitoring
- Include proper cache error handling and recovery
- Implement cache testing and debugging tools
- Support cache A/B testing capabilities
- Include proper cache documentation and best practices

## Dependencies
- Caching frameworks and libraries
- Storage and file systems
- Network optimization tools
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Testing and debugging tools

## Notes
- Consider caching performance trade-offs
