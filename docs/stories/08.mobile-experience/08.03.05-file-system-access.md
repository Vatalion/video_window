# Creative Pack File System Access for Social Commerce

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev | **Priority:** High | **Epic:** Mobile Device Access | **Quality Score:** 9.4/10

## Story
As a social commerce creator, I want to access my device's file system for creative packs and assets with intelligent storage management and marketplace integration, so that I can quickly import effects, LUTs, and templates while maintaining device performance, avoiding storage issues, and monetizing my creative assets through the platform.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Raw file access lacks creator-focused workflows, storage health monitoring, privacy safeguards, and marketplace integration, leading to poor organization, device performance issues, potential security risks, and missed monetization opportunities.
- **Solution**: Creative pack-focused file access with intelligent storage management, privacy filters, one-tap import workflows, and direct marketplace integration that enhances creator velocity while protecting device performance and enabling asset monetization.
- **Impact**: Improve creative asset import speed by 60%, reduce storage-related app crashes by 85%, increase template usage by 45% through better asset organization, and enable 30% of creators to monetize through asset marketplace integration.
