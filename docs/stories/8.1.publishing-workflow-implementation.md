# Story 8.1: Publishing Workflow Implementation

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** maker,
**I want** to publish my completed stories to the marketplace,
**so that** viewers can discover and make offers on my work

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **BUSINESS CRITICAL**: Maker can review completed story with all required sections (overview, process timeline, materials, notes) before publishing, with validation preventing incomplete story publication.
2. Maker can set minimum offer price (≥ $1.00) before publishing, with client-side validation and server-side enforcement of pricing rules.
3. Maker can preview how story will appear in feed before publishing, showing exact layout, video thumbnail, and metadata as viewers will see it.
4. Maker can publish story with single "Publish" action after validation passes, triggering status change and feed indexing within 5 minutes.
5. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Published story appears in main feed within 5 minutes with proper discovery algorithm integration and real-time feed updates.
6. Maker receives confirmation notification when story is live with feed placement details and initial visibility metrics.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 7.1 – Maker Story Capture & Editing Tools (draft creation and editing workflow)
2. Story 7.3 – Draft Autosave & Sync System (draft storage and retrieval)
3. Story 4.1 – Home Feed Implementation (feed discovery and rendering)
4. Story 6.1 – Media Pipeline Content Protection (video content processing)

  - [ ] Display minimum price and marketplace fee breakdown
  - [ ] Require explicit confirmation checkbox before publishing
  - [ ] Show loading state during publish API call
  - [ ] Handle publish success/failure states with appropriate messaging

### Phase 3 – Feed Integration & Notifications

- [ ] **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Integrate with feed discovery algorithm (AC: 5) [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Workflow & docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md – Content Recommendation]
  - [ ] Add published stories to feed index via Redis queue
  - [ ] Update recommendation engine weights for new content
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation for affected feed queries
  - [ ] Monitor feed appearance latency with target < 5 minutes
- [ ] Implement real-time feed updates (AC: 5) [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Workflow]
  - [ ] Use WebSocket connection for live feed refresh notifications
  - [ ] Push published story to connected viewers' feeds
  - [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates for maker's own feed
  - [ ] Handle feed position and ranking updates
- [ ] Build publication confirmation notification system (AC: 6) [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Workflow]
  - [ ] Create `StoryPublishedNotification` event in notification system
  - [ ] Include feed placement details and initial view count
  - [ ] Add deep link to published story in notification
  - [ ] Trigger maker dashboard update with publication metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- This is the first story in Epic 8. It depends on Epic 7 (Story Capture & Editing) for draft workflow and Epic 4 (Feed Browsing) for discovery integration. Story 8.2 will add moderation checks before publication.

### Data Models
- `Story` entity adds `published_at` timestamp, `min_offer_price` (Money type), and `publishing_status` enum field. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing States]
- `PublishingStatus` enum includes: draft, pending_review, approved, published, rejected, taken_down, archived. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing States]
- Minimum offer price stored as `Money` value object with currency code for international support. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Workflow]

### API Specifications
- `POST /stories/{id}/publish` requires story ownership validation, completeness checks, and minimum price validation before status transition. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Publishing Workflow]
- Returns published story entity with feed placement metadata and estimated visibility timeline.
- Feed indexing occurs asynchronously via Redis queue with 5-minute SLA for appearance.

### Component Specifications
- Publishing feature package `video_window_flutter/packages/features/publishing/` hosts presentation layer (pages, widgets, BLoCs) and publishing use cases. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-8.md – Source Tree]
- Core module repositories/services in `video_window_flutter/packages/core/` expose story validation and publishing APIs.
- Server endpoints for publishing workflow in `video_window_server/lib/src/endpoints/story/` handle status transitions and feed integration.
- Feed integration leverages existing recommendation engine from Epic 4 implementation.
