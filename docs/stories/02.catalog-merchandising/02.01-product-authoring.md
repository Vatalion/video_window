# Video-First Product Authoring with AI Intelligence

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Catalog & Merchandising Foundation

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues impacting product impact**
  - Form-forward flow underemphasizes video-first shoppable creation and time-to-live; risks slow catalog growth.
  - No auto-coaching to reach "publishable" quality (images/video, pricing, inventory) or first-sale readiness.
  - Measurement gaps: missing targets for publish speed, shoppable-attachment rate, and draft abandonment.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Make it video-first: encourage a 9:16 clip at authoring; allow quick clip trim and shoppable moment tagging.
  - Add readiness scorecard: block publish on critical gaps; show guided fixes and completion meter.
  - KPIs: p50 time-to-first-publish < 10 min, shoppable-video attach rate > 60%, draft abandonment < 25%.
  - Experimentation: 10% holdout on AI-copy vs template to validate uplift in publish rates and PDP conversion.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - AI assist for titles, bullets, and thumbnails; "import from competitor link" for faster bootstrap with human review.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with video-first authoring, readiness scorecard, and KPIs.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## Story
As a creator merchandising new products,
I want a video-first authoring workspace with AI-assisted setup and real-time coaching,
so that I can publish shoppable products quickly while meeting catalog data quality standards and maximizing conversion potential.

## Business Value
- **Problem:** Traditional form-based product authoring is slow, lacks video-first focus, and provides no real-time coaching, leading to slow catalog growth and poor product quality.
- **Solution:** Video-first authoring with AI intelligence, readiness scoring, and real-time coaching to accelerate product creation and ensure quality.
- **Impact:** 60% faster time-to-publish, 40% improvement in product quality scores, and 25% increase in conversion rates through shoppable video content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Video-First Authoring Flow:** Creators are prompted to record or upload a 9:16 vertical video (minimum 15 seconds) as the primary product asset; video trimming interface enables precise clip selection with frame-accurate editing; shoppable moment tagging allows CTA placement at specific timecodes with preview functionality; system prioritizes video content in the authoring workflow with auto-save every 30 seconds. **Verification:** Manual testing confirms 95% of creators start with video; analytics track shoppable moment attachment rate >60%; auto-save recovery rate >99%.
2. **AI-Assisted Content Generation:** System generates suggested titles, bullet points, and thumbnail options using AI prompts with multi-language support; creators can edit, regenerate, or manually override suggestions; "import from competitor link" feature extracts key product attributes with human review workflow and compliance checking; 10% holdout group for A/B testing AI vs template copy effectiveness with statistical significance validation. **Verification:** AI suggestion adoption rate >40%; competitor import accuracy >85%; A/B test shows >15% uplift in publish rates; multi-language support covers 15+ languages.
3. **Readiness Scorecard & Coaching:** Dynamic completion meter displays real-time score (0-100) blocking publish on critical gaps; guided fixes highlight missing sections with specific improvement suggestions and one-tap fixes; time-to-publish tracked with KPI target of p50 < 10 minutes; shoppable-video attachment rate target > 60%; offline support for draft editing with conflict resolution. **Verification:** Scorecard prevents 100% of incomplete publishes; p50 time-to-publish <10min; abandonment rate <25%; offline sync success rate >99%.
4. **Smart Media Management:** System supports up to 10 images and 1 primary video with intelligent cropping for feed safe zones; auto-generates multiple thumbnail variants optimized for different placements; enforces size limits with compression guidance (images ≤10MB, video ≤500MB); performance targets: first thumbnail < 500ms, first playable < 2s on 4G. **Verification:** Load testing confirms performance SLAs; safe zone compliance 100%; compression reduces size by 40-60%.
5. **Shoppable Story Integration:** Authors can link existing video stories to products, preview shoppable moments with timecode markers, and automatically import product metadata from story content; system validates story approval status and suggests optimal CTA placement based on engagement analytics. **Verification:** Story linkage success rate >95%; CTA placement accuracy >90%; metadata import completeness >98%.
6. **Variant Intelligence:** Variant builder supports up to 3 option dimensions with AI-powered combination suggestions; auto-generates SKU matrix with pricing recommendations based on material costs and market data; highlights high-margin and popular combinations for creators. **Verification:** AI suggestion accuracy >80%; SKU generation error rate <1%; margin improvement >15% for recommended combinations.
7. **Dynamic Pricing Guidance:** Price entry includes real-time market comparison, competitor pricing analysis, and profit margin calculations; multi-currency support with automatic tax category selection; alerts creators when pricing deviates significantly from market averages. **Verification:** Price accuracy >99%; market deviation detection >95%; tax category selection accuracy 100%.
8. **Performance Analytics Integration:** System surfaces real-time analytics during authoring including similar product performance, seasonal demand trends, and category conversion benchmarks; provides actionable insights to optimize product setup before publish; draft abandonment rate target < 25%. **Verification:** Analytics load time <2s; insight adoption rate >30%; seasonal trend accuracy >85%.

## Dev Notes
- **Architecture Alignment:** Follow modular structure outlined in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`; commerce catalog components reside under `lib/features/commerce/` with data/domain/presentation separation.
- **Coding Standards:** Apply patterns from `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`, including Riverpod for state, AsyncValue error handling, and theming via shared UI kit.
- **Media Services:** Reuse existing S3/Serverpod integration patterns referenced in PRD media sections; coordinate with backend on chunk size and transcoding triggers; ensure ABR ladder optimized for 9:16 video content.
- **AI Copy & Coaching Hooks:** Implement extensible AI prompt service with feature switch for rapid iteration; integrate with existing content generation endpoints; provide human review workflow for competitor import feature.
- **Performance Targets:** First thumbnail generation < 500ms, first playable video < 2s on 4G, catalog freshness score > 80%, median time-to-feature < 24h.
- **Security & Compliance:** Ensure pricing and tax selection align with compliance guidance; sensitive draft data stored locally must be encrypted where possible.
- **Analytics:** Instrument per `docs/architecture/data-instrumentation.md`, capturing completion time, abandonment reasons, publish success, and AI effectiveness metrics.

### Testing
- Unit/widget tests in `test/features/commerce/` following the testing pyramid from `docs/testing-qa-strategy.md`.
- Integration/E2E tests under `integration_test/features/commerce/` using fake Serverpod endpoints and mocked media uploads.
- Include golden tests for key form sections if visual stability is critical; store in `test/golden/commerce/`.
- QA checklist should cover accessibility (screen readers, dynamic text), localization, offline/autosave, and video-story linkage edge cases.
