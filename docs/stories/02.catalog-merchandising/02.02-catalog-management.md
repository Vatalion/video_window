Draft

## Priority
High

## Epic
Commerce System (1.0) - Enable marketplace administrators to efficiently manage and organize product catalogs to improve customer product discoverability and administrator productivity.

## Story
As a marketplace administrator,
I want to manage and organize product catalogs with advanced filtering and categorization,
so that customers can easily discover and browse products through improved search and navigation.
