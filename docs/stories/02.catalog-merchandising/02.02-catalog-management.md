# Dynamic Catalog Management with Real-time Campaign Curation

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Catalog & Merchandising Foundation

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues impacting product impact**
  - Heavy on admin tables; light on freshness signals and real-time campaigns that feed discovery
  - No governance to auto-archive stale SKUs or surface trending bundles; misses feedback loops to creators
  - Missing performance/freshness SLOs and catalog health score
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Campaign curation: dynamic groups (new this week, rising, back-in-stock), auto-refresh daily
  - Staleness automation: auto-archive/rehydrate rules; creator nudges when items decay
  - KPIs: catalog freshness score > 80, median time-to-feature < 24h, duplicate rate < 1%
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - "Merch coach" hints to improve PDP readiness and variant coverage
- **Final Assessment**
  - **Decision**: Conditional GO — proceed if freshness automation and KPIs are in scope
  - **Implementation Readiness Score**: 6.5 / 10
  - **Confidence Level**: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Story lacks template sections (`Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records); acceptance criteria not instrumented despite being numbered

- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria target high performance (<1s, bulk operations) without instrumentation or clear ownership
  - Tasks skew front-end; backend impacts (batch imports, analytics, duplication detection) need explicit mapping to services
  - Dependencies reference generic systems; tie to actual stories/files for catalog data and analytics
  - Introduce dynamic campaign grouping, trend alerts, and auto-archive flows that keep discovery feeds stocked with relevant items
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Document analytics for catalog health, duplicate detection, and admin productivity
  - Provide UX guidance for bulk workflows and error remediation
  - Instrument catalog health dashboards and automate stale inventory nudges to merchants
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Serverpod streaming references require confirmation; ensure architecture alignment
- **Final Assessment**
  - **Decision**: NO-GO
  - **Implementation Readiness Score**: 4 / 10
  - **Confidence Level**: Low

## Epic
Commerce System (1.0) - Enable marketplace administrators to efficiently manage and organize product catalogs to improve customer product discoverability and administrator productivity.

## Story
As a marketplace administrator,
I want to manage and organize product catalogs with dynamic campaign curation and freshness automation,
so that customers can easily discover trending products and creators receive actionable insights to optimize their catalog performance.

## Business Value
- **Problem:** Traditional catalog management is static, lacks real-time freshness signals, and provides no automated insights to creators, leading to poor product discovery and stale inventory.
- **Solution:** Dynamic catalog management with real-time campaign curation, automated freshness monitoring, and AI-powered creator insights.
- **Impact:** 40% reduction in catalog management time, 20% increase in product discovery, and 15% improvement in creator revenue through optimized inventory.
