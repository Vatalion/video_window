# Social-Driven Inventory Management with Real-time Pulses

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Catalog & Merchandising Foundation

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- Critical Issues impacting product impact
  - Classical stock control; misses social scarcity loops and live pulses to drive demand without oversell.
  - Forecasting claims lack architecture backing and measurable protections at checkout.
  - No creator alerts for hype moments or waitlist funnels.
- Should-Fix to unblock
  - Live inventory pulses to storefront and creator dashboards; low-stock alerts and "nearly gone" badges.
  - Checkout protections: atomic holds at variant level, waitlist with notify-on-restock.
  - KPIs: oversell rate < 0.1%, low-stock alert CTR > 15%, restock notify-to-purchase > 10%.
- Nice-to-Have (high leverage)
  - Drop-mode tooling to stage and release inventory with countdowns.
- Final Assessment
  - Decision: Conditional GO â€” ship pulses, protections, and KPIs; defer heavy forecasting if unready.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 6.5 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Story lacks template sections (`Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records) and acceptance criteria headings use custom format.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - No Dev Notes summarizing architecture for WebSockets, forecasting, supplier sync, or warehouse flows; implementation path unclear.
  - Absent testing plan for real-time tracking, forecasting accuracy, barcode scanning, and supplier integrations.
  - Inventory story mirrors traditional stock control and ignores social scarcity loops driving drop culture.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria list numerous ambitious targets (<1s refresh, 99.9% accuracy) without instrumentation or responsible teams.
  - Tasks mention packages and APIs but omit integration sequencing, source tree references, or data governance.
  - Compliance/security around supplier data, forecasting, and returns should be documented with references.
  - Implement real-time inventory pulses, waitlist funnels, and creator low-stock alerts that orchestrate hype-driven restocks.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Add analytics requirements for oversell incidents, stock turns, supplier performance, and returns.
  - Provide UX guidance for dashboards, alerts, and multi-location management.
  - Model conversion impact of scarcity moments and share with creators to tune drop cadence.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Forecasting and supplier sync claims require architecture confirmation; ensure dependencies exist before implementation.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **4 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

  - Inventory story mirrors traditional stock control and ignores social scarcity loops driving drop culture.
  - Implement real-time inventory pulses, waitlist funnels, and creator low-stock alerts that orchestrate hype-driven restocks.
  - Model conversion impact of scarcity moments and share with creators to tune drop cadence.
## Primary Story Reference
This implementation depends on **Story 1.1.1: Commerce Product Creation** for the foundational product data structure and inventory fields, and is part of the broader commerce system.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Commerce & Monetization System (PRD section: Commerce Inventory Management Features) and enables marketplace administrators to effectively manage product inventory and stock levels with real-time tracking.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing overselling incidents by 95% and optimizing stock management efficiency by 40% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Overselling prevention: Reduce overselling incidents by 95%
- Stock management efficiency: Improve inventory turnover rate by 40%
- Real-time tracking accuracy: Maintain 99.9% inventory accuracy
- Administrator productivity: Reduce time spent on inventory tasks by 35%

## Domain Context
**Inventory Management** refers to the systematic approach to sourcing, storing, and selling inventory (goods or services). In e-commerce contexts, this involves tracking stock levels, managing warehouse locations, handling returns, and forecasting demand.

**Real-time Tracking** means inventory levels are updated immediately as transactions occur, without manual intervention or batch processing delays.

**Overselling** occurs when more items are sold than are available in stock, leading to customer dissatisfaction and operational complications.

## Technical Context
This story builds upon the product data structure established in Story 1.1.1. The inventory management system will be implemented as a new feature module in `lib/features/inventory/` following the existing project architecture patterns.

Key technical considerations:
- Integration with existing product models from Story 1.1.1
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Local data caching for offline functionality
- API endpoints for inventory operations (to be defined in services layer)

## Story
As a marketplace creator and administrator,
I want to manage product inventory with real-time pulses, social scarcity signals, and hype-driven demand mechanics,
so that I can prevent overselling while creating urgency, optimizing restock workflows, and maximizing conversion through social proof.

## Business Value
- **Problem:** Traditional inventory management lacks real-time social integration, leading to overselling, missed urgency opportunities, and poor creator insights.
- **Solution:** Social-driven inventory management with real-time pulses, scarcity signals, and hype mechanics to prevent overselling while maximizing conversion.
- **Impact:** 95% reduction in overselling, 25% increase in conversion through scarcity, and 40% improvement in inventory turnover.
