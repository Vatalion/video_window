# Implementation: Story 1.4.1 - Commerce Inventory Management

## Status
Draft

## Priority
Medium

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation depends on **Story 1.1.1: Commerce Product Creation** for the foundational product data structure and inventory fields, and is part of the broader commerce system.

## Business Context
This story is part of the Commerce & Monetization System (PRD section: Commerce Inventory Management Features) and enables marketplace administrators to effectively manage product inventory and stock levels with real-time tracking.

The feature directly supports the business goal of reducing overselling incidents by 95% and optimizing stock management efficiency by 40% as specified in the product requirements document.

Key business metrics this story will impact:
- Overselling prevention: Reduce overselling incidents by 95%
- Stock management efficiency: Improve inventory turnover rate by 40%
- Real-time tracking accuracy: Maintain 99.9% inventory accuracy
- Administrator productivity: Reduce time spent on inventory tasks by 35%

## Domain Context
**Inventory Management** refers to the systematic approach to sourcing, storing, and selling inventory (goods or services). In e-commerce contexts, this involves tracking stock levels, managing warehouse locations, handling returns, and forecasting demand.

**Real-time Tracking** means inventory levels are updated immediately as transactions occur, without manual intervention or batch processing delays.

**Overselling** occurs when more items are sold than are available in stock, leading to customer dissatisfaction and operational complications.

## Technical Context
This story builds upon the product data structure established in Story 1.1.1. The inventory management system will be implemented as a new feature module in `lib/features/inventory/` following the existing project architecture patterns.

Key technical considerations:
- Integration with existing product models from Story 1.1.1
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Local data caching for offline functionality
- API endpoints for inventory operations (to be defined in services layer)

## Story
**As a** marketplace administrator,
**I want** to manage product inventory and stock levels with real-time tracking,
**so that** I can prevent overselling and optimize stock management.

## Mobile UI/UX Design Requirements

### Touch Interaction Design
- **Gesture-Based Inventory Management**: Swipe gestures to navigate between inventory views, pinch-to-zoom for stock level charts
- **Thumb-Friendly Controls**: All primary inventory actions positioned within easy reach, minimum 44px tap targets
- **Quick Adjustment**: Fast stock level adjustment through tap-and-hold gestures
- **Batch Operations**: Multi-select capability for batch inventory updates with long-press activation

### Responsive Interface Components
- **Adaptive Inventory Display**: Grid layout for product inventory on tablets, list view on mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live inventory changes
- **Orientation Handling**: Seamless transition between portrait and landscape modes with preserved inventory state
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Customizable inventory dashboard for at-a-glance monitoring

### Visual Design System
- **Admin-Specific Theme**: Professional dark theme optimized for extended inventory management sessions
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded stock level indicators (red for low stock, yellow for medium, green for adequate)
- **Visual Alerts**: Clear notification badges for inventory alerts and warnings
