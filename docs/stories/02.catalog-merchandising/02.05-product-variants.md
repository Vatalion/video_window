# Story 2.5: Product Variant Management System

## 1. Title
Unified product variant modeling, editing, and merchandising experience for craft marketplace listings.

## 2. Context
Marketplace administrators and power sellers need granular control over product variations (size, color, bundle, finish, made-to-order options). Today variants are modeled as separate SKU entries, fragmenting analytics, inventory, and pricing logic. Customer interviews show 38% cart abandonment when desired variants are out of stock or hard to locate, and merchandising teams report 2x effort to keep pricing synchronized across variations.

This story introduces a dedicated variant system layered on top of product authoring (02.01) and media management (02.03). It centralizes variant definitions, inventory tracking, pricing adjustments, and imagery so buyers can dial in preferences without leaving the PDP (product detail page). The system must support both physical goods (e.g., yarn colorways) and digital deliverables (e.g., template bundles) with conditional availability driven by material supply, production lead times, or regional regulations.

Success metrics:
- Increase variant selection conversion rate by 20% within 60 days.
- Reduce catalog maintenance time for merchandising teams by 45%.
- Decrease customer support tickets about incorrect variants by 35%.

Dependencies:
- Product authoring foundation (02.01-product-authoring.md)
- Inventory management (02.04-inventory-management.md)
- Pricing & tax engine (05.05-pricing-tax-engine.md)
- Media management for variant imagery (03.03-media-management-system.md)

## 3. Requirements
**PO Validated Requirements**

### Variant Modeling & Authoring
- Create variant families with up to three option axes (e.g., size, color, material). 
- Support custom option labels, value ordering, and localized terminology.
- Allow default variant selection and fallback recommendations when preferred variant unavailable.
- Provide bulk import/export for variant matrices (CSV) to streamline onboarding.

### Inventory & Availability
- Link each variant to inventory pools with independent stock levels and availability rules.
- Specify make-to-order lead times, preorder/backorder policies, and blackout windows.
- Surface real-time availability to storefront and checkout services.

### Pricing & Promotions
- Variant-level price adjustments (absolute or percentage) with preview of final price, tax, and discounts.
- Compatibility with promotional campaigns, bundles, and loyalty pricing.
- Track historical price changes per variant for auditing.

### Media & Content
- Associate variant-specific media (images, videos, 360° spins) prioritized in PDP gallery.
- Auto-generate alt text templates derived from variant attributes.
- Support materials/ingredients metadata per variant for compliance.

### Analytics & Operations
- Variant performance dashboard: impressions, selection rate, conversion, returns.
- Alerting for low-stock or high-return variants.
- Role-based permissions (merchandiser vs contributor vs auditor).

### Technical & Quality
- Public API endpoints to query variant definitions and availability.
- Ensure backward compatibility with legacy SKU references via migration layer.
- ACID guarantees on variant updates tied to inventory changes.
- Audit log retained 24 months.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. **Variant Creation** – Merchandiser can define multi-axis variants and publish them without errors; PDP renders variant selector accordingly.
2. **Inventory Sync** – Variant stock changes propagate to storefront and checkout within 5 seconds.
3. **Pricing Rules** – Variant-specific price adjustments and promotions display correctly in cart and checkout summaries.
4. **Media Association** – Selecting a variant updates gallery and thumbnails to relevant media with proper alt text.
5. **Availability Policies** – Preorder/backorder rules enforce stated lead times and customer messaging.
6. **Analytics Dashboard** – Variant performance dashboard loads with filterable metrics per product, variant, and date range.
7. **Bulk Operations** – CSV import/export handles at least 1,000 variants with validation and error reporting.
8. **API Exposure** – Partner API returns variant definitions, availability, and pricing through authenticated endpoints.
9. **Audit Trail** – Every variant change records who/when/what and is retrievable via admin interface.
10. **Migration Support** – Legacy SKU links redirect to corresponding variants without breaking bookmarks.

## 5. Process & Rules
- All variant definitions must tie back to a canonical product master record.
- Inventory holds and reservations occur at variant level to avoid overselling.
- Variant deprecation requires inventory clearance plan and archive approval from merchandising lead.
- Pricing adjustments exceeding 40% require finance approval before publish.
- Accessibility review ensures variant selector usable with keyboard and assistive tech.

## 6. Tasks / Breakdown
- **Data Modeling & Storage**
  - Extend catalog data model for variant families, option values, and SKU mapping.
  - Build migration scripts to map legacy SKUs to new variant entities.
- **Authoring Experience**
  - Implement variant matrix editor with bulk edit and templating.
  - Add validation for duplicate combinations and incomplete attribute sets.
- **Inventory & Pricing Integration**
  - Connect to inventory service for real-time stock updates per variant.
  - Extend pricing engine for variant overrides and promotion compatibility.
- **Storefront & API**
  - Update PDP and cart controllers to consume variant APIs.
  - Provide partner API endpoints with pagination, filtering, and caching.
- **Analytics & Alerts**
  - Instrument variant events and build dashboards using analytics platform (07.02-analytics-platform.md).
  - Configure alerting thresholds and notification hooks.
- **Testing & QA**
  - Automated tests for variant selection flow, pricing accuracy, and availability edge cases.
  - Manual accessibility and cross-device testing for variant UI.
