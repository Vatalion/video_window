  - No measurement for selector friction or variant-level conversion.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Dynamic variant ordering per user/session; smart default selection; prefetch variant media.
  - Bundles and "complete the look" kits with price transparency; PDP guidance for OOS variants.
  - KPIs: variant selection conversion +20%, selector dwell < 5s p95, OOS fallback retention > 40%.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - Try-before-you-buy eligibility routing for high-return categories.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO â€” proceed with dynamic ranking, bundles, and KPIs.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Document uses narrative format; template sections (`Status`, `Priority`, `Acceptance Criteria` numbering, `Tasks / Subtasks`, `Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records) missing or misaligned.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - No Dev Notes consolidating data model changes, migration steps, or integration with catalog/checkout services; teams lack concrete implementation map.
  - Testing plan absent for variant creation, pricing overrides, analytics, and migration validation.
  - Variant management is spreadsheet-style and lacks personalization or bundle intelligence.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria need measurable targets (sync latency, dashboard update cadence) and instrumentation ownership.
  - Tasks high-level; specify service/component changes, rollout plan, and compatibility considerations.
  - Governance for variant lifecycle, attribution, and analytics should reference supporting policies.
  - Enable dynamic variant ranking per user, smart bundles, and try-before-you-buy routing for higher conversion.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Add analytics instrumentation expectations (variant uptake, performance alerts) and UX guidance for PDP selector states.
  - Provide migration communication plan for creators/merchandisers.
  - Measure variant engagement heatmaps and feed insights back to merchandising teams.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Claims about API exposure and migration support must align with architecture capabilities; verify before implementation.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **4 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**
