# Interactive Product Media Management with Shoppable Overlays

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Catalog & Merchandising Foundation

## PO Validation Review (2025-09-22)
- **Critical Issues impacting product impact**
  - Treats media as static assets; lacks shoppable overlays, timecodes, and safe areas for in-feed placement.
  - Performance/quality targets unowned; no ABR/thumbnail SLAs for short video loops.
  - No creator-facing analytics to guide media refresh decisions.
- **Should-Fix to unblock**
  - Add interactive hotspots/timecoded CTAs compatible with feed player; validate safe zones.
  - Performance targets: first thumbnail < 500ms, first playable < 2s on 4G; ABR ladder tuned for 9:16.
  - Creator insights: media engagement dashboard and freshness alerts.
- **Nice-to-Have (high leverage)**
  - Auto-tagging (ASR/vision) to suggest product linkage; manual review required.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: Conditional GO — proceed with shoppable overlays and perf SLAs.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 7 / 10
  - Confidence Level: Medium

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Missing template sections (`Dev Notes`, `Testing`, `Change Log`, agent records); acceptance criteria headings use emojis and should convert to numbered list per template.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - No Dev Notes connecting media pipeline, storage tiers, or CDN strategy—implementation lacks authoritative references.
  - Testing plan absent for compression quality, transcoding latency, and bulk operations.
  - Media handling treats assets as static files without interactive commerce overlays or quality guarantees.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Acceptance Criteria include aggressive targets (50% compression, <2s thumbnails) without instrumentation, ownership, or fallback strategy.
  - Tasks reference packages (flutter_image_compress, video_compress) and watermarking but don't confirm compatibility or backend support.
  - Security/protection requirements (watermark, download prevention) need explicit governance and legal review references.
  - Add adaptive cropping, interactive hotspots, and automated compliance checks to ensure shoppable overlays land perfectly in feed.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Capture analytics for media quality, engagement, and failure rates.
  - Provide UX guidance for editors (batch operations, alt text prompts) and compliance messaging.
  - Surface media performance analytics to creators and auto-suggest refreshes for aging assets.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - AI tagging and 360° support promises require validation in architecture; otherwise risk over-scoping.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **4 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**
