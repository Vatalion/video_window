# Story 1.9: Security Audit System Implementation

**Status**: IN_QA

## 1. Title
Comprehensive account security monitoring and audit logging system with real-time threat detection and response capabilities.

## 2. Context
**PO Validation**: This story addresses the critical need for robust security monitoring in the crypto market application. With increasing security threats and regulatory requirements, users and system administrators require comprehensive tools to monitor account activities, detect suspicious behavior, and maintain security compliance. This builds upon existing authentication (Story 1.1), session management (Story 1.5), and device management (Story 1.8) capabilities to create a complete security ecosystem.

## 3. Requirements
**PO Validation**: The following explicit requirements have been validated:
- Complete audit logging for all account security events with comprehensive event tracking
- Real-time suspicious activity detection using anomaly detection algorithms
- Multi-channel security event notifications (email and push notifications)
- Account lockout protection with configurable failed attempt thresholds
- Password strength validation and enforcement
- Optional security question backup system
- Security audit log retention with configurable policies
- Security dashboard for real-time account activity monitoring
- Compliance with industry security logging best practices
- Security incident response and reporting capabilities

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**QA Validation**: The following testable acceptance criteria must be met:
1. **Audit Logging**: All security events are logged with user_id, event_type, timestamp, IP address, user agent, device_id, risk_score, and event_details
2. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Real-time detection and alerting for anomalous behavior patterns
3. **Security Notifications**: Immediate notifications via email and push for security events
4. **Account Lockout**: Automatic account protection after configurable failed attempts
5. **Password Validation**: Enforcement of password strength requirements
6. **Security Questions**: Optional backup security question system implementation
7. **Log Management**: Configurable audit log retention and search capabilities
8. **Security Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring dashboard with visualizations
9. **Compliance**: Adherence to security logging best practices and standards
10. **Incident Response**: Complete security incident response and reporting workflow

## 5. Process & Rules
**SM Validation**: Implementation must follow these established processes:
- **Naming Convention**: Use Security prefix for all security-related components (SecurityAuditLog, SecurityAlert, SecurityDashboard)
- **Data Architecture**: Implement clean architecture with data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Security Standards**: All audit logs must be encrypted and comply with data protection regulations
- **Testing Requirements**: Complete unit, widget, integration, and security testing coverage
- **API Standards**: Follow RESTful conventions with proper error handling and authentication
- **Documentation**: All components must include comprehensive documentation
- **Code Review**: Security-related code requires enhanced review process

## 8. Notes
**PO/PM/SM/QA Consolidation**:
- **Dependencies**: Requires completion of Stories 1.1 (Authentication), 1.5 (Session Management), and 1.8 (Device Management)
- **Security Priority**: This is a critical security feature requiring enhanced code review
- **Performance Considerations**: Audit logging must not impact application performance
- **Compliance Requirements**: Must adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and financial industry regulations
- **Timeline**: Estimated 4-6 weeks for complete implementation
- **Resources**: Requires security specialist involvement for threat detection algorithms
