- Cart item reordering and organization capabilities
- Save items for later functionality
- Cart item comparison features
- Cart item recommendations based on contents

**Technical Requirements:**
- React-based cart component interfaces
- Proper state management for cart operations

3. **Quantity Management**: Users can update item quantities with real-time validation, maximum limits, and bulk update capabilities
4. **Product Variant Handling**: System properly handles product variants with specific pricing, availability checking, and image handling
5. **Validation System**: Real-time availability checking, price validation, product restrictions handling, and comprehensive error handling
6. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select functionality, select all operations, bulk removal/updates, and bulk move to wishlist
7. **Cart Organization**: Drag-and-drop reordering, cart grouping by category, custom organization options, and sorting features
8. **Save for Later**: Save items interface, saved items management, price drop notifications, and restore to cart functionality
9. **Comparison Features**: Item comparison interface, comparison criteria selection, side-by-side comparison views, and comparison sharing
10. **Recommendations**: Cart-based recommendation engine, upsell/cross-sell suggestions, frequently bought together items, and personalized recommendations

**Performance Criteria:**
- Cart load time <1s for carts with up to 100 items
- Add to cart response time <500ms including validation
- Quantity update response time <300ms with real-time validation
- Bulk operations <2s for processing 100 items simultaneously
- Cart synchronization <1s across devices
- Consistent performance on devices with 2GB RAM

## 5. Process & Rules
**Development Process:**
- Follow agile methodology with 3-week sprints
- Implement test-driven development with 95%+ code coverage
- Conduct daily standups for cart functionality progress updates
- Weekly technical reviews for cart architecture and optimization
- Sprint reviews for cart interface demonstrations

**Quality Assurance Rules:**
- All cart functionality must pass unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Performance benchmarks must be met before release
- Security scanning must show zero critical vulnerabilities
- Accessibility testing must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- User acceptance testing must be completed by product owner

**Integration Rules:**
- API contracts must be signed between frontend and backend teams
- Real-time updates must use WebSocket connections with fallback mechanisms
- Inventory synchronization must use queue-based update systems
- Cart data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Cross-team handoffs must be documented and validated

**Deployment Rules:**
- Features must be rolled out using feature flags
- Performance monitoring must be in place before deployment
- Rollback procedures must be documented and tested
- Deployment must follow staged rollout approach
- Post-deployment monitoring must be active for 72 hours
