## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 4 has no prior stories implemented, so this serves as the foundation for the feed browsing experience. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-4--feed-browsing-experience]

### Data Models
- The `stories` table stores video content with metadata for feed algorithms, including engagement metrics and personalization data. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#database-schema-excerpt]
- Feed service modules rely on Postgres `stories` and `user_engagement` tables to manage content ordering and personalization. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-4--feed-browsing-experience]

### API Specifications
- `GET /stories/feed` accepts pagination parameters (`page`, `limit`, `cursor`) and personalization filters, returning paginated story items with metadata. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-4--feed-browsing-experience]
- Feed responses include video URLs, thumbnails, engagement data, and next page cursors for infinite scroll implementation. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#networking--data-layer-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Flutter `feed` package owns home feed list, video playback controls, and engagement UI; Story service on Serverpod provides feed data and personalization. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-4--feed-browsing-experience]
- BLoC-based state management with feature-scoped FeedBLoC orchestrates feed flows, with components organized under `features/feed/` layers. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#state-management]
- Use shared analytics service injection to record feed events instead of duplicating event names. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#analytics-instrumentation]

### File Locations
- UI and state code for this story belong under `packages/features/feed/` following presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure layering. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#feature-package-structure]
- Tests should mirror feature paths under `packages/features/feed/test/` to match the unified package structure. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain â‰¥80% coverage and include integration coverage for feed flows, running `melos run test` for all packages. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
- Feed BLoCs and widgets should use bloc_test package and widget tests for critical feed screens with performance benchmarks. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]

### Technical Constraints
- Feed implementation requires TikTok-style vertical scrolling with video auto-play, infinite pagination, and performance optimization for 60fps scrolling. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-4--feed-browsing-experience] [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md]
- **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: All feed implementations must maintain 60fps scrolling with <=2% jank on mid-range devices. [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md#performance-targets-and-benchmarks]
- **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Video auto-play must implement proper resource management with controller pooling and memory optimization. [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md#video-performance-optimization]
- **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Crash-safe resume must persist state securely and handle all failure scenarios gracefully. [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md#memory-management]
- **UX CRITICAL**: Feed interactions must be accessible with proper semantic labels and reduced motion support. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#accessibility]
- **ANALYTICS CRITICAL**: Feed events must follow naming conventions and include comprehensive engagement tracking. [Source: analytics/mvp-analytics-events.md#feed]
- Serverpod feed endpoint enforces rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user); implement client-side rate messaging aligned with backend protections. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#networking--data-layer-architecture]
- Error handling must surface friendly messages and retry actions via shared `ErrorView` components. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#error-handling]
- All performance controls must implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for performance degradation. [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md#performance-monitoring-and-debugging]

### Project Structure Notes
- Planned changes align with the documented unified package structure; no deviations identified. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#video-marketplace-unified-package-structure]

## Testing
- Follow the project testing pipeline by running `melos run format`, `melos run analyze`, and `melos run test` before submission. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#development-workflow]
- Add BLoC and widget tests for feed flows with fixtures covering pagination, auto-play, and performance scenarios. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
- Include performance benchmark tests for scroll performance, memory usage, and video auto-play functionality. [Source: architecture/performance-optimization-guide.md#performance-testing]
