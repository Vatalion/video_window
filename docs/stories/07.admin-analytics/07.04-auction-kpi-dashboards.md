# 07.04 — Auction KPI Dashboards

## Status
InProgress

## Priority
P0 (Pilot)

> Workflow: Draft → InProgress → Ready for Review → Done

## Summary
Create dashboards to track pilot KPIs and health: bid proposal rate, time-to-first-bid, bids per auction distribution (liquidity), and event health/error rates, with filters for region (UA), creator, and time window.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard panels:
  - Funnel: feed_impression → cta_propose_bid_tap → bid_submitted → bid_confirmed
  - Time-to-first-bid: median and P90
  - Bids per auction distribution and % with ≥2 bids within 24h
  - Event error rate (<1%) and missing event checks
- Filters: region (UA), date range, creator, item
- Data freshness ≤ 15 minutes (or documented SLA for the stack)
- Sharing: accessible to the team; snapshot export for reports

## Telemetry/Data
- Relies on events: feed_impression, cta_propose_bid_tap, bid_submitted, bid_confirmed, auction_opened, bids_list_viewed, auction_state_changed, error_*.

## Notes
- Start with current analytics stack; iterate on visualizations after pilot.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Define dashboard panels as per Acceptance Criteria (funnel, TTFB, distribution, error rate).
- Implement filters (region, date range, creator, item) and dashboard variables.
- Connect to event schema; ensure data is arriving; add SLAs and freshness indicators.
- Create access and sharing controls; snapshot export setup.
- Document dashboard links and runbook for discrepancies.

## Dev Agent Record
- Engineer: TBD
- Dates: TBD
- Notes: Prefer calculated fields for funnels; ensure consistent session/region attribution.

## QA Results
- Owner: TBD
- Test window: TBD
- Summary: Pending; validate panel calculations, filters, and freshness SLA.

## Definition of Done
- All Acceptance Criteria validated
- Telemetry hooked per analytics schema
- Unit/Widget/Integration tests added and passing
- Accessibility and performance checks completed
- Documentation updated (README/CHANGELOG as needed)
