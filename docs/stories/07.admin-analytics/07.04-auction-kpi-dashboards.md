# 07.04 — Auction KPI Dashboards

Status: Draft → InProgress → Ready for Review → Done

## Summary
Create dashboards to track pilot KPIs and health: bid proposal rate, time-to-first-bid, bids per auction distribution (liquidity), and event health/error rates, with filters for region (UA), creator, and time window.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard panels:
  - Funnel: feed_impression → cta_propose_bid_tap → bid_submitted → bid_confirmed
  - Time-to-first-bid: median and P90
  - Bids per auction distribution and % with ≥2 bids within 24h
  - Event error rate (<1%) and missing event checks
- Filters: region (UA), date range, creator, item
- Data freshness ≤ 15 minutes (or documented SLA for the stack)
- Sharing: accessible to the team; snapshot export for reports

## Telemetry/Data
- Relies on events: feed_impression, cta_propose_bid_tap, bid_submitted, bid_confirmed, auction_opened, bids_list_viewed, auction_state_changed, error_*.

## Notes
- Start with current analytics stack; iterate on visualizations after pilot.
