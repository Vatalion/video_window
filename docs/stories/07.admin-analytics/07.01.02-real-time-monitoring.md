# Real-time Monitoring System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** real-time performance metrics and error tracking,
**so that** I can proactively identify and resolve system issues before they impact users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time performance metrics display for CPU, memory, disk usage, and network I/O
2. Error tracking with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and categorization
3. System health indicators with color-coded status (Green/Yellow/Red) for all services
4. Resource utilization monitoring with historical trends (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days)
5. Predictive alerting system that identifies potential issues before they occur
6. Dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds with manual refresh option
7. Performance threshold configuration with customizable alert levels
8. Historical data export for performance analysis and reporting
9. Service dependency mapping showing how service outages affect other systems
10. Mobile-responsive design for monitoring on mobile devices

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/monitoring/
- Test standards: Component tests with mocked real-time data, integration tests for WebSocket connections
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E tests
- Mock real-time data streams for testing performance and error scenarios

### Relevant Source Tree
- Monitoring components: src/components/admin/monitoring/
- WebSocket services: src/services/admin/websocket/
- Data processing: src/services/admin/analytics/
- Alerting system: src/services/admin/alerts/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/monitoring/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use WebSocket for real-time data streaming with fallback to polling
- Implement time-series database for historical metric storage (InfluxDB or similar)
- Use Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- Apply debounce and throttling for performance optimization
- Implement proper error boundaries for monitoring components
- Use Redux Saga for handling WebSocket connections and data flow
- Apply proper access control for sensitive monitoring data

### Architecture Integration
- Follows real-time architecture patterns from backend-architecture.md
- WebSocket implementation follows patterns from external-apis.md
- Component structure follows frontend-architecture.md
- Data models follow data-models.md for metrics and alerts
