## 5. Process & Rules
**Workflow/Process Notes Validated by SM:**

### Development Process:
- **DP1:** Follow agile development with 2-week sprints
- **DP2:** Implement test-driven development (TDD) approach
- **DP3:** Daily standup meetings for progress tracking
- **DP4:** Weekly code reviews and quality assurance
- **DP5:** Continuous integration and deployment pipeline

### Quality Standards:
- **QS1:** Code must pass ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **QS2:** Unit test coverage minimum 80%
- **QS3:** Integration tests for all API endpoints
- **QS4:** Performance testing for dashboard components
- **QS5:** Security testing for administrative functions

### Naming Conventions:
- **NC1:** Component files use PascalCase (e.g., `DashboardWidget.tsx`)
- **NC2:** Service files use camelCase (e.g., `userManagementService.ts`)
- **NC3:** Test files follow pattern `{Component}.test.tsx`
- **NC4:** CSS classes use kebab-case (e.g., `dashboard-widget`)
- **NC5:** API endpoints use snake_case (e.g., `/system_metrics`)

### Documentation Rules:
- **DR1:** All functions require JSDoc comments
- **DR2:** Complex logic includes inline comments
- **DR3:** README files for all major components
- **DR4:** API documentation updated with changes
- **DR5:** User guides for administrative features
