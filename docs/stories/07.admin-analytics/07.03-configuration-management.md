# System Configuration and Integration Management

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High

## Story
As a system administrator,
I want a comprehensive platform for managing application settings, business rules, and third-party integrations,
so that I can safely configure and maintain the platform with proper governance and controls.

- [ ] **Given** I am implementing risky changes, **When** I deploy configurations, **Then** I can set rollback timers that automatically revert changes with 99% success rate and <30-second recovery time
- [ ] **Given** I am managing business rules, **When** I create rules, **Then** I can test and simulate rules before deployment with AI-assisted recommendations that improve rule efficiency by 25%
- [ ] **Given** I am monitoring integrations, **When** I view integration health, **Then** I can see real-time status with automated recovery and 99.5% uptime with <1-minute failure detection
- [ ] **Given** I am tracking changes, **When** I review audit logs, **Then** I can see complete version control with change tracking and 100% audit trail coverage with cryptographic verification
- [ ] **Given** I am deploying changes, **When** I push configurations, **Then** I can deploy across all environments in real-time with 100% consistency and staging parity verification
- [ ] **Given** I am optimizing rules, **When** I use the management interface, **Then** I receive AI-powered recommendations that improve rule efficiency by 25% with performance impact analysis
- [ ] **Given** I am testing commerce features, **When** I run experiments, **Then** I can conduct A/B tests with proper targeting and 95% statistical confidence and real-time KPI correlation
- [ ] **Given** I am using mobile devices, **When** I access configuration tools, **Then** I have full functionality with offline editing capabilities and biometric authentication supporting Face ID/Touch ID

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 95% reduction in configuration errors, 99.95% deployment success rate, 25% improvement in operational efficiency, 80% faster experiment cycles
- **Technical Metric**: <5 minute deployment time, 99.9% change accuracy, 99.5% integration uptime, <100ms read response time, 95% cache hit rate
- **User Metric**: 95% administrator satisfaction, 99% rollback success rate, 100% audit trail completeness, 80% reduction in manual configuration time

## Technical Requirements
- **Mobile-First Interface**: Flutter 3.16+ with Material 3 design system, responsive layouts for tablets and phones, touch-optimized controls, and adaptive UI for different screen sizes
- **Feature Flag Service**: LaunchDarkly or similar SaaS solution with targeting capabilities, percentage rollouts, gradual releases, and safety mechanisms using Flutter Provider/BLoC for state management
- **Configuration Management System**: Git-like versioning system with branching, merge capabilities, atomic commits, and change tracking with PostgreSQL as primary storage
- **Business Rule Engine**: Apache Drools or similar rules engine with testing sandbox, simulation capabilities, rule dependency analysis, and AI-powered optimization using TensorFlow Lite
- **Integration Platform**: Real-time health monitoring with WebSocket connections, automated recovery mechanisms, and RESTful API support for 5,000+ RPS
- **Data Management**: Redis caching with 95% hit rate for <100ms read operations, AES-256 encryption for sensitive data, and 15-minute RPO backup system
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Real-time KPI correlation with business metrics, blast-radius visualization using Neo4j or similar graph database, and predictive impact analysis
- **Security & Compliance**: OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect authentication, multi-level RBAC, biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID), and 100% audit trail coverage with cryptographic verification
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second response times for 100,000+ configuration items, offline editing with Hive database, and conflict resolution algorithms
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment with staging parity verification, one-click rollback functionality, and <30-second recovery time

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Feature flag service (LaunchDarkly or similar), pricing engine APIs, integration platform, authentication system
- **Business**: Stakeholder approval for automated deployment, compliance team sign-off for audit requirements
- **Prerequisites**: Admin dashboard infrastructure, user authentication system, audit logging framework

## Out of Scope
- Custom feature flag service development (use existing SaaS solutions)
- Advanced machine learning model training for rule optimization
- Enterprise-level multi-tenant architecture beyond basic isolation
- Custom integration development beyond standard connectors
- Advanced workflow automation beyond basic approval processes
- Custom mobile app development beyond responsive web interface

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: 95% code coverage for core configuration management logic, business rule evaluation, and feature flag operations
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of configuration deployment pipeline, rollback mechanisms, and cross-environment synchronization
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with 10,000+ concurrent users, stress testing for failure scenarios, and battery optimization for mobile usage
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing for configuration access controls, audit trail verification, and biometric authentication validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Mobile-first usability testing with focus on touch interactions, offline scenarios, and emergency configuration procedures
- **A/B Testing**: Validation of AI-powered recommendations and rule optimization effectiveness with statistical significance testing

## Edge Cases and Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Graceful handling of intermittent connectivity during configuration synchronization with offline mode support
- **Configuration Conflicts**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution algorithms for concurrent configuration changes
- **System Failures**: Automatic failover mechanisms and circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
- **Security Breaches**: Immediate lockout procedures and audit trail preservation for unauthorized access attempts
- **Data Corruption**: Automated rollback to last known good state with data integrity verification
- **Performance Degradation**: Adaptive throttling and caching strategies during high load periods

## User Experience Considerations
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-optimized controls with larger tap targets, swipe gestures for navigation, and adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with voice control support, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast themes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex configuration options organized in collapsible sections with contextual help and tooltips
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live preview of configuration changes with visual indicators and impact assessment
- **Emergency Access**: Quick actions for critical configuration changes with simplified workflows for urgent scenarios
- **Learning Curve**: Interactive tutorials, guided workflows, and context-sensitive documentation for new administrators
