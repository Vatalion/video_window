## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/analytics/
- Test standards: Data validation tests, API endpoint tests, UI component tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E analytics workflows
- Mock data generation for testing analytics scenarios and edge cases

### Relevant Source Tree
- Analytics components: src/components/admin/analytics/
- Data processing: src/services/admin/analytics/
- Report builder: src/services/admin/reports/
- Data warehouse: src/services/admin/data-warehouse/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/analytics/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript for analytics dashboard components
- Implement data visualization with Chart.js, D3.js, or similar library
- Use Web Workers for heavy data processing to prevent UI blocking
- Implement proper data aggregation and caching strategies
- Use WebSocket for real-time analytics updates
- Apply responsive design for multi-device analytics access
- Implement proper error handling for data processing failures
- Use lazy loading for large datasets and historical data

### Architecture Integration
- Analytics data flow follows backend architecture patterns
- Data warehouse implementation follows database-schema.md patterns
- API endpoints follow rest-api-spec.md guidelines
- Component structure follows frontend-architecture.md
- Testing strategy follows testing-strategy.md requirements
