# Analytics Platform Implementation - Real-time Data Processing & Creator Insights

## Status
Refined - PO Review Addressed

## Priority
High

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Missing `Priority`, testing summary, and change log updates; acceptance criteria lack measurable thresholds and instrumentation owners.
  - Dev Notes reference React/TypeScript/Jest stack inconsistent with Flutter-based repo; template misalignment.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Scope mirrors parent analytics platform—no differentiation or incremental slice defined.
  - Data warehouse/ETL assumptions lack architecture references, data governance, or compliance plan for PII.
  - Story doesn't tie analytics outputs to habit-forming loops (creator monetization, co-shopping insights) that drive product outcomes.
  - Implementation lacks streaming governance, observability budgets, or consumer empowerment.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Identify dependencies (event streaming, BI tooling, experimentation) and instrumentation (data freshness, governance).
  - Provide security/privacy requirements (row-level access, anonymization) and cost considerations.
  - Replace placeholder QA/Dev sections with actionable guidance or remove until relevant.
  - Add scalable event schemas, contract linting, and clear SLO dashboards for data consumers.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Plan automated storytelling (insight cards, alerts) to keep stakeholders engaged.
  - Introduce shareable reports tailored to creators and commerce teams for retention loops.
  - Automate drift detection and notify teams when quality regresses.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Referenced directories and docs may not exist; verify before planning.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **2 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**
