Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive user account management tools,
**so that** I can efficiently manage user accounts, permissions, and access controls across the platform.

4. User segmentation and targeting tools based on behavior patterns and demographics
5. Role-based access control (RBAC) system with customizable permissions
6. User verification management including email verification, phone verification, and ID verification
7. User communication tools for sending targeted messages and notifications
8. User behavior analytics and activity tracking
9. User import/export functionality with CSV and Excel support
10. Audit trail for all user management actions with timestamps and administrator information

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/users/
- Test standards: CRUD operation tests, validation tests, bulk operation tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E user management workflows
- Include tests for permission validation and audit trail creation

### Relevant Source Tree
- User management components: src/components/admin/users/
- User services: src/services/admin/users/
- Access control: src/services/admin/auth/
- Audit system: src/services/admin/audit/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/users/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript for type-safe user management
- Implement form validation with Yup or similar schema validation
- Use DataTable or similar component for large user lists
- Implement proper pagination and lazy loading for performance
- Use Web Workers for heavy bulk operations
- Apply proper error handling and user feedback
- Implement role-based UI rendering based on current admin permissions
- Use encryption for sensitive user data handling

### Architecture Integration
- User management follows backend architecture patterns
- Authentication and authorization follow security patterns from architecture docs
- Audit system follows logging and monitoring patterns
- Data models follow user schemas from data-models.md
