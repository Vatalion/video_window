# Trust and Safety Intelligence User Account Management

## Status
Refined - Ready for Development

## Priority
High

## PO Validation Review (2025-02-14)
- **Template Compliance Issues**
  - Missing `Priority`, testing summary, updated change log; acceptance criteria lack measurable thresholds and instrumentation.
  - Dev Notes cite React/Jest paths inconsistent with Flutter repo; template misalignment persists.
- **Critical Issues (Story Blocked)**
  - Duplicates admin dashboard scope; unclear boundaries vs parent story and other user-management stories (identity-access).
  - Handles sensitive operations (bulk deletes, verification) without architecture references, legal/compliance plan, or audit strategy.
  - Fails to tie user management to habit-forming outcomes (creator success, retention) or social-commerce loops.
  - Admin account handling is compliance-focused and ignores trust-and-safety intelligence.
- **Should-Fix Issues**
  - Define dependencies (identity services, analytics, notifications) and instrumentation (admin action latency, impact on churn).
  - Provide security posture (least privilege, approvals) and escalation policies for risky actions.
  - Replace placeholder QA/Dev sections with actionable instructions or remove until needed.
  - Empower teams with behavioral heatmaps, strike escalation, and automation loops for rapid response.
- **Nice-to-Have Improvements**
  - Add AI-assisted insights (flag at-risk creators, suggest outreach) to keep admins engaged and proactive.
  - Plan segmentation experiments tied to personalization engine and marketing loops.
  - Track intervention outcomes and highlight creator rehabilitation stories.
- **Anti-Hallucination Findings**
  - Referenced directories (`src/components/...`) likely absent; verify before implementation.
- **Final Assessment**
  - Decision: **NO-GO**
  - Implementation Readiness Score: **2 / 10**
  - Confidence Level: **Low**

  - Admin account handling is compliance-focused and ignores trust-and-safety intelligence.
  - Empower teams with behavioral heatmaps, strike escalation, and automation loops for rapid response.
  - Track intervention outcomes and highlight creator rehabilitation stories.

## Story
As a trust and safety intelligence administrator,
I want AI-powered user account management tools with behavioral heatmaps, social commerce impact analysis, strike escalation systems, and automated intervention loops,
so that I can proactively identify at-risk creators 72 hours before churn, reduce creator attrition by 25%, protect revenue streams, and maintain platform safety while driving creator success and retention through data-driven interventions.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Manual user management processes cannot scale to identify at-risk creators proactively, lack understanding of social commerce behavioral patterns, and fail to provide automated interventions that protect revenue and ensure platform safety
- **Solution**: AI-powered trust and safety intelligence system that correlates user behavior with commerce impact, provides predictive insights, and automates intervention workflows to protect both creators and the platform ecosystem
- **Impact**: 25% reduction in creator churn, 85% accuracy in identifying at-risk creators 72 hours before departure, 100% protection of revenue streams during interventions, and 60% improvement in operational efficiency for trust and safety teams

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Intelligent Account Management Interface** - Deliver user CRUD operations with 99.9% availability and <500ms response time for single-user actions, integrated with identity services from Story 1.7. **Given** the system is under peak load, **when** an admin performs user CRUD operations, **then** response times remain <500ms with 99.9% availability. **Verification**: Load test with 1000 concurrent operations, measure response times and success rates.

2. **AI-Powered Search and Filtering** - Implement behavioral pattern search that identifies at-risk users with 85% accuracy, reducing manual investigation time by 60%. Filter by activity patterns, engagement drops, compliance violations, and commerce performance. **Given** a dataset of 100K users, **when** an admin searches for at-risk creators, **then** the system returns results with 85% accuracy in <2 seconds. **Verification**: Run search performance tests with 100K user dataset, validate prediction accuracy against historical intervention data.

3. **Bulk Operations with Trust Intelligence** - Enable bulk account actions with intelligent risk scoring that escalates high-risk operations requiring multi-level approval, achieving 95% automation rate for routine actions while maintaining 100% audit coverage. **Given** a bulk operation affecting 10K users, **when** the operation is initiated, **then** the system automatically routes based on risk score with 100% audit trail. **Verification**: Execute bulk operations on test dataset of 10K users, measure automation rate and audit trail completeness.

4. **Creator Success Segmentation** - Develop behavioral segmentation that correlates user management actions with business outcomes, increasing creator retention by 15% and average revenue per creator by 20%. **Given** admin interventions on creator accounts, **when** tracking 90-day cohorts, **then** measure 15% increase in retention and 20% increase in revenue per creator. **Verification**: Track creator cohorts pre/post intervention, measure retention and revenue impact over 90-day period.

5. **Dynamic RBAC with Least Privilege** - Implement context-aware role-based access control that adapts permissions based on user risk scores, admin trust levels, and compliance requirements, reducing permission violations by 99%. **Given** varying admin trust levels and user risk profiles, **when** admin actions are performed, **then** permissions adjust dynamically with 99% violation prevention. **Verification**: Conduct penetration testing with 500 permission scenarios, measure violation rate detection.

6. **Verification Workflow Integration** - Connect user verification status to trust scoring system, automatically adjusting verification requirements based on behavioral patterns and compliance history, improving verification completion rates by 40%. **Given** user behavioral patterns and compliance history, **when** verification requirements are assessed, **then** the system automatically adjusts requirements with 40% completion improvement. **Verification**: Process 5K verification requests, measure completion rates and fraud detection accuracy.

7. **Intelligent Communication System** - Deploy AI-suggested messaging for at-risk users that increases response rates by 35% and reduces churn by 25%, with message effectiveness tracked against creator success metrics. **Given** at-risk user identification, **when** AI-suggested messages are sent, **then** response rates increase by 35% and churn decreases by 25%. **Verification**: A/B test messaging strategies, measure response rates and churn reduction impact.

8. **Behavioral Heatmap Analytics** - Create real-time behavioral heatmaps that identify emerging threats and opportunities, enabling proactive interventions that reduce policy violations by 45% and increase creator success stories by 30%. **Given** real-time user activity data, **when** behavioral patterns are analyzed, **then** heatmaps display emerging threats with 90% accuracy. **Verification**: Monitor heatmap accuracy over 30-day period, measure intervention effectiveness.

9. **Compliant Data Operations** - Implement import/export functionality with automated compliance checking that processes 100K records in <10 minutes with 99.99% data accuracy and 100% GDPR/CCPA compliance. **Given** data import/export requests, **when** processing large datasets, **then** complete 100K records in <10 minutes with 100% compliance validation. **Verification**: Process large datasets with compliance validation, measure processing time and accuracy.

10. **Comprehensive Audit Intelligence** - Build audit trails with AI-powered anomaly detection that identifies suspicious patterns with 90% accuracy and generates automated reports for compliance review, reducing audit preparation time by 70%. **Given** administrative actions across the system, **when** audit trails are analyzed, **then** detect suspicious patterns with 90% accuracy. **Verification**: Simulate 10K administrative actions, measure anomaly detection accuracy and report generation efficiency.
