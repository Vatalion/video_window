# System Configuration Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive system configuration management interface,
**so that** I can manage application settings, feature flags, and environment configurations efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application settings and preferences management with organized categories and sections
2. Feature flags and toggles system with granular control and targeting capabilities
3. Environment management for development, staging, and production configurations
4. Configuration deployment and rollback with version control and change tracking
5. Configuration validation and testing before deployment
6. Configuration backup and restore functionality
7. Configuration synchronization across multiple servers and environments
8. Configuration change approval workflow with role-based permissions
9. Configuration history and audit trail with comparison tools
10. Configuration import/export functionality for backup and migration

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/configuration/
- Test standards: Configuration validation tests, deployment tests, rollback tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E configuration workflows
- Include tests for configuration validation, deployment, and rollback scenarios

### Relevant Source Tree
- Configuration components: src/components/admin/configuration/
- Feature flags: src/services/admin/feature-flags/
- Environment management: src/services/admin/environments/
- Deployment: src/services/admin/deployment/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/configuration/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript for configuration management interface
- Implement configuration schema validation
- Use Git-based version control for configuration changes
- Apply proper encryption for sensitive configuration data
- Implement real-time configuration updates with WebSocket
- Use Web Workers for heavy configuration processing
- Apply proper caching strategies for configuration data
- Implement proper error handling and validation feedback

### Architecture Integration
- Configuration management follows backend architecture patterns
- Feature flags follow feature management patterns from architecture docs
- Environment management follows deployment patterns from development-workflow.md
- API endpoints follow rest-api-spec.md guidelines
- Testing strategy follows testing-strategy.md requirements
