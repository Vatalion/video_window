## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/reports/
- Test standards: Drag-and-drop functionality tests, data processing tests, export tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E report building workflows
- Include tests for template creation, sharing, and automation features

### Relevant Source Tree
- Report builder components: src/components/admin/reports/
- Template system: src/services/admin/reports/templates/
- Data processing: src/services/admin/reports/processing/
- Automation: src/services/admin/reports/automation/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/reports/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript and React DnD for drag-and-drop functionality
- Implement Chart.js or similar for visualization components
- Use Web Workers for heavy data processing in report generation
- Apply proper caching strategies for report data
- Implement WebSocket for real-time data updates
- Use PDF generation libraries like jsPDF for PDF exports
- Apply responsive design principles for mobile compatibility
- Implement proper error handling for data processing failures

### Architecture Integration
- Report builder follows component-based architecture from frontend-architecture.md
- Data processing follows backend architecture patterns
- API endpoints follow rest-api-spec.md guidelines
- Visualization components follow design system from components.md
- Testing strategy follows testing-strategy.md requirements
