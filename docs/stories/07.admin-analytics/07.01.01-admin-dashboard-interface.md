## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/dashboard/
- Test standards: Follow Jest/React Testing Library patterns
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- Dashboard tests should include widget rendering, data fetching, and user interactions

### Relevant Source Tree
- Admin dashboard components: src/components/admin/dashboard/
- System monitoring: src/services/admin/monitoring/
- User management: src/services/admin/users/
- Content management: src/services/admin/content/
- Dashboard API endpoints: src/api/admin/dashboard/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript for dashboard components
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Use Chart.js or similar for data visualization
- Apply responsive design principles for multi-device support
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use Redux or Context API for state management
- Apply proper access control checks at component level

### Architecture Integration
- Dashboard follows component-based architecture from frontend-architecture.md
- Data fetching uses API patterns from rest-api-spec.md
- Styling follows design system from components.md
- State management uses patterns from core-workflows.md
