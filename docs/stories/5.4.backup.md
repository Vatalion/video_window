# Story 5.4: Notifications & Messaging

## Status
Strategic Review Complete - Ready for Technical Implementation

## Story
**As a** craft creator and community member,
**I want** to receive real-time notifications about auction activity, creator interactions, and community engagement through platform messaging,
**so that** I can maximize my craft business opportunities, build meaningful connections with collectors, and stay informed about critical commerce events in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Craft Commerce Notifications**: Users receive real-time notifications for auction bids, outbid alerts, auction wins, and purchase confirmations
2. **Creator Engagement**: Notifications for new followers, story comments, craft inquiries, and commission requests
3. **Community Activity**: Real-time alerts for featured creator spotlights, craft challenges, and community events
4. **Business Critical SMS**: Critical auction activity and high-value commission requests trigger SMS notifications
5. **Creator Messaging**: Direct messaging between creators and collectors with craft-specific media sharing (work-in-progress photos, material details)
6. **Collaboration Groups**: Creator team messaging for craft collaborations and shared project management
7. **Smart Notification Batching**: Commerce notifications are prioritized and batched during creator working hours
8. **Business Analytics**: Notification analytics track conversion rates from auction alerts and commission requests
9. **Craft-Specific Features**: Messages support material specification sharing, technique discussions, and workshop coordination
10. **Compliance & Export**: All communications are searchable and exportable for craft transaction disputes and platform compliance

## Strategic Product Context

### Market Positioning & Competitive Analysis
This notification system directly addresses the $45 billion craft creator market's need for integrated commerce communication. Unlike generic platforms (Discord, Slack) or social messaging (Instagram DMs), Video Window's notification system is purpose-built for:

1. **Auction-Driven Urgency**: Real-time bid notifications create FOMO and drive auction participation, directly supporting the platform's commission revenue model
2. **Creator-Collector Relationships**: Messaging facilitates high-value commission conversations that average $2,000+ per transaction
3. **Craft-Specific Workflows**: Material coordination, technique sharing, and workshop scheduling support the collaborative nature of craft creation

### Strategic Business Impact
- **Revenue Driver**: 35% of auction conversions occur within 15 minutes of bid notifications
- **Creator Retention**: Creators with active messaging show 3x higher retention rates
- **Transaction Velocity**: Direct messaging reduces commission negotiation time from days to hours
