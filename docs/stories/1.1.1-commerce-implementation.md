# Implementation: Story 1.1 - Commerce Product Creation

## Status
**Status:** Draft

## Primary Story Reference
This implementation depends on **Story 1.1: User Registration with Email/Phone Verification** for user authentication and account verification.

## Story
**As a** marketplace administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive product creation interface,
**so that** I can efficiently add and manage products across different categories and types.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Product creation form with all required fields
2. Support for multiple product types (physical goods, digital goods, services)
3. Rich text editor for product descriptions and specifications
4. Image and video upload capabilities with validation
5. Pricing configuration fields
6. Inventory management options
7. Shipping and delivery settings
8. Product variants and configuration support
9. Form validation and error handling
10. Save as draft and publish options

# Dev Notes
## Testing
- Test file location: tests/unit/commerce/product-creation/
- Test standards: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Pytest for backend
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use:
  - Unit tests for form validation logic
  - Integration tests for product creation workflow
  - E2E tests for complete product creation flow
  - API testing for product CRUD operations

## Technical Requirements
- Use React Form for form management
- Implement file upload with AWS S3 integration
- Use Redux for state management of product data
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Add accessibility features for form navigation

## Integration Points
- User authentication system for admin access
- Media management service for file uploads
- Inventory management system
- Payment processing system for pricing validation
- Analytics service for product tracking

## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- The repository is Flutter/Dart, but this implementation plan still assumes a React stack (React Form, Redux, Jest/Pytest). The tooling, file paths, and testing guidance need to be rewritten for Flutter before work can proceed.
- Every task remains unchecked, so the "Draft" specification captures planning only—no evidence of partial implementation or alignment with existing Flutter modules.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- Current source tree only exposes `lib/features/{cart,device_management,profile,recovery,security,shipping}` and `test/features/...`; there is no `lib/features/commerce` or `tests/unit/commerce/...`, so the file locations in this spec must be rewritten to match the Flutter layout before engineers can execute.
- `pubspec.yaml` confirms the project depends on Flutter packages (bloc, drift, dio, etc.) and does not include the React/AWS/S3 tooling referenced here—swap in concrete Flutter/Dart dependencies or call out provisioning steps.
- The “Primary Story Reference” still points at user-registration Story 1.1 even though this document covers commerce product creation; clarify whether this implementation should be renumbered or if a different parent story drives it.
