# Story: RESTful API Architecture Implementation

## 1. Title
Implement comprehensive RESTful API architecture with proper endpoints, error handling, and versioning for robust client communication.

## 2. Context
The application requires a solid foundation for API communication with proper REST principles, versioning, and error handling. As a backend developer, I need to implement a comprehensive RESTful API architecture so that the application can provide robust, scalable, and maintainable web services for all client applications. This story covers the core API infrastructure setup that will serve as the foundation for all subsequent API development.

## 3. Requirements
- **API Structure**: Design RESTful endpoint structure for all resources with proper naming conventions and URL patterns
- **Framework Setup**: Set up API framework with proper middleware, request/response handling pipeline, CORS settings, and security headers
- **Error Handling**: Implement standardized error response format with error code classification system and logging
- **Versioning**: Implement URL-based versioning (/v1/, /v2/) with deprecation policy and migration documentation
- **Testing**: Create comprehensive API test suite with unit and integration tests for all endpoints
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain API specification documentation following OpenAPI 3.0 standards
- **Security**: Implement rate limiting, CORS configuration, and proper HTTP status code usage

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- All endpoints follow RESTful principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- API responses are consistently formatted across all endpoints
- Error responses include proper HTTP status codes and descriptive messages
- API versioning is implemented and documented with clear migration paths
- All endpoints are tested with comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
- API documentation is generated and accessible via OpenAPI specification
- Rate limiting is implemented where appropriate with proper headers
- CORS configuration works for all allowed origins and environments
- Performance impact is minimal (< 5ms per request for middleware)

## 5. Process & Rules
- **Development Approach**: Use shelf or equivalent Dart HTTP server framework for implementation
- **Code Organization**: Follow modular architecture with separate directories for routers, controllers, models, and middleware
- **Version Control**: Implement semantic versioning for API changes with backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date OpenAPI specification with automated generation
- **Testing**: Require minimum 90% test coverage for all API components
- **Security**: Implement proper input validation, sanitization, and security headers
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize API response times under load
- **Error Handling**: Use standardized error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes
