# 2.1 Shopping Cart Persistence and Synchronization

## 1. Title
**Persistent Shopping Cart with Cross-Device Synchronization**

## 2. Context
As a customer, I want a persistent shopping cart that maintains my items across sessions and devices, so that I can continue shopping seamlessly and don't lose my selected products. This story addresses the common customer pain point of cart abandonment due to session timeouts, device switches, or accidental browser closures. The implementation will improve customer retention and conversion rates by providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple touchpoints.

## 3. Requirements
- **PO Validated**: Cart persistence across browser sessions
- **PO Validated**: Cross-device cart synchronization in real-time
- **PO Validated**: Cart item storage optimization for performance
- **PO Validated**: Session management with configurable timeouts
- **PO Validated**: Cart backup and recovery mechanisms
- **PO Validated**: Anonymous cart handling for non-authenticated users
- **PO Validated**: Cart data encryption for security
- **PO Validated**: Performance optimization for large carts (100+ items)
- **PO Validated**: Cart conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- **PO Validated**: Cart analytics tracking for business insights

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. **Cart Persistence**: Cart items are preserved when user closes browser or switches devices
2. **Cross-Device Sync**: Cart updates appear within 2 seconds across all user devices
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Cart data storage uses less than 5KB per item including metadata
4. **Session Management**: Session timeout configurable between 15-120 minutes with auto-renewal
5. **Backup Recovery**: Users can restore cart from any point in last 30 days
6. **Anonymous Support**: Non-authenticated users maintain cart for 7 days
7. **Data Encryption**: All cart data encrypted at rest and in transit
8. **Performance**: Cart operations complete in under 500ms with 1000 items
9. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic merge of concurrent changes with user notification
10. **Analytics Tracking**: Cart behavior logged with 95% accuracy for analysis

## 5. Process & Rules
- **SM Validated**: All cart operations must be atomic and consistent
- **SM Validated**: Cart state management follows Redux pattern with immutability
- **SM Validated**: Sync conflicts resolved using "last writer wins" with user override
- **SM Validated**: Anonymous carts upgraded to authenticated carts on user login
- **SM Validated**: Cart history limited to 30 days with automatic cleanup
- **SM Validated**: Performance monitoring implemented for all cart operations
- **SM Validated**: Error handling includes user-friendly messages and retry mechanisms
- **SM Validated**: Security audits performed quarterly on cart data handling
