# Dev Notes
## Technical Requirements
- Use Flutter's animation and gesture libraries for drag-and-drop
- Implement custom timeline widget with Flutter's Canvas API
- Use text rendering libraries for overlays and captions
- Create video editing backend for segment processing
- Implement audio track management with Flutter's audio libraries
- Build state management system for timeline data

## Integration Points
- Video capture system for imported video segments
- Media management service for video and audio assets
- Text rendering service for overlays and captions
- Video processing backend for transitions and effects
- User preferences system for timeline settings
- Storage service for timeline project files

## Comprehensive Testing Requirements

### Core Functionality Testing
- **Timeline Operations**:
  - Test drag-and-drop precision with 50+ segments
  - Validate timeline rendering performance with complex layouts
  - Test text overlay rendering accuracy across all formats
  - Validate segment timing precision to millisecond accuracy
  - Test transition effects rendering quality and performance
  - Validate timeline scrubbing precision and responsiveness
  - Test multi-track synchronization under heavy load

### Performance Testing
- **Timeline Performance**:
  - Measure timeline rendering time with 100+ segments
  - Validate memory usage during complex operations (< 150MB)
  - Test drag-and-drop response time (< 100ms)
