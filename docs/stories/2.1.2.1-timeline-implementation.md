# Dev Notes
## Technical Requirements
- Use Flutter's animation and gesture libraries for drag-and-drop
- Implement custom timeline widget with Flutter's Canvas API
- Use text rendering libraries for overlays and captions
- Create video editing backend for segment processing
- Implement audio track management with Flutter's audio libraries
- Build state management system for timeline data

## Integration Points
- Video capture system for imported video segments
- Media management service for video and audio assets
- Text rendering service for overlays and captions
- Video processing backend for transitions and effects
- User preferences system for timeline settings
- Storage service for timeline project files

## Comprehensive Testing Requirements

### Core Functionality Testing
- **Timeline Operations**:
  - Test drag-and-drop precision with 50+ segments
  - Validate timeline rendering performance with complex layouts
  - Test text overlay rendering accuracy across all formats
  - Validate segment timing precision to millisecond accuracy
  - Test transition effects rendering quality and performance
  - Validate timeline scrubbing precision and responsiveness
  - Test multi-track synchronization under heavy load

### Performance Testing
- **Timeline Performance**:
  - Measure timeline rendering time with 100+ segments
  - Validate memory usage during complex operations (< 150MB)
  - Test drag-and-drop response time (< 100ms)
  - Measure real-time preview rendering performance
  - Validate battery consumption during extended editing
  - Test timeline save/load performance with large projects

### Security Testing
- **Data Protection**:
  - Test timeline project data encryption
  - Validate secure storage of user preferences
  - Test collaborative editing access controls
  - Validate data integrity for timeline corruption
  - Test secure deletion of temporary files

### Accessibility Testing
- **iOS Accessibility Compliance**:
  - Test VoiceOver navigation for timeline controls
  - Validate Dynamic Type support for text elements
  - Test color contrast compliance (> 4.5:1)
  - Validate switch control compatibility
  - Test accessibility for users with motor impairments

### Edge Case Testing
- **Timeline Scenarios**:
  - Test behavior with zero-duration segments
  - Validate performance with nested timeline structures
  - Test recovery from timeline corruption scenarios
  - Validate handling of extremely long timelines (30+ minutes)
  - Test timeline operations with low storage conditions
  - Validate behavior with unsupported media formats

### Integration Testing
- **System Integration**:
  - Test integration with video capture system
  - Validate media management system compatibility
  - Test authentication integration with project ownership
  - Validate commerce tracking for timeline elements
  - Test collaborative editing conflict resolution

### Regression Testing
- **Baseline Testing**:
  - Establish performance benchmarks for all operations
  - Create automated test suite for timeline functionality
  - Validate backward compatibility with existing projects
  - Test integration points with dependent systems
  - Validate user experience consistency across updates

## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- All tasks remain unchecked; the document is still a Draft scoped at planning level with no actionable implementation notes for the Flutter client.
- Specification references custom video editing backends and collaborative tooling that are not represented anywhere in the repo; needs concrete architecture or phased scope aligned with available infrastructure.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- The repo has no `lib/features/timeline` (or similar) module and no `backend/` directory; please spell out where the timeline widgets, state, and services should live inside the current Flutter architecture.
- Tooling such as the "video editing backend" and multi-track rendering pipeline is not represented in dependencies or scriptsâ€”add provisioning steps or adjust the story to something the current stack can support.
