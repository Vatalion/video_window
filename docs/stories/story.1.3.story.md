# Story 1.3 - Multi-Factor Authentication System

## 1. Title
Implement multi-factor authentication system for enhanced account security using SMS and authenticator app methods.

## 2. Context
This story addresses the critical need for enhanced account security by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA). Building upon the authentication foundation established in Story 1.1, this feature will provide users with two-factor authentication options: SMS-based verification and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) through authenticator apps. The implementation is driven by increasing security requirements, user demand for account protection, and industry best practices for safeguarding user accounts against unauthorized access.

## 3. Requirements
**Validated by PO:**

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1.1**: Users must be able to enable SMS-based 2FA on their account with phone number verification
- **FR1.2**: Users must be able to enable authenticator app-based 2FA (TOTP) with QR code setup
- **FR1.3**: 2FA setup must be available during initial registration process
- **FR1.4**: Users must be able to enable/disable 2FA methods in account settings
- **FR1.5**: System must generate and provide backup codes for account recovery scenarios
- **FR1.6**: 2FA verification must be required for sensitive account actions
- **FR1.7**: Grace period must be implemented for 2FA setup on new devices
- **FR1.8**: 2FA bypass options must be available for account recovery scenarios
- **FR1.9**: System must handle invalid 2FA codes with proper error messaging
- **FR1.10**: Implementation must comply with security best practices for 2FA

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: MFA verification response time must be under 3 seconds
- **NFR2**: 100% test coverage for all MFA components
- **NFR3**: Zero security vulnerabilities in MFA implementation
- **NFR4**: Rate limiting must be implemented for SMS and verification attempts
- **NFR5**: 2FA secrets must be stored encrypted at rest

### Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Authentication system provides foundation for MFA integration
- **SMS Service**: Third-party SMS service for code delivery
- **TOTP Library**: Implementation must use TOTP algorithm (RFC 6238)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Verified by QA:**

1. **SMS 2FA Setup**: Given a user with a verified phone number, when they enable SMS 2FA, then they receive a verification code via SMS and can complete setup
2. **TOTP 2FA Setup**: Given a user with an authenticator app, when they enable TOTP 2FA, then they can scan a QR code or enter manual setup details to complete setup
3. **Registration Integration**: Given a new user during registration, when they reach the security settings step, then they can optionally set up 2FA
4. **Settings Management**: Given a user with enabled 2FA, when they access account settings, then they can view, disable, or change their 2FA method
5. **Backup Code Generation**: Given a user who enables 2FA, when the setup is complete, then they receive 10 backup codes for account recovery
6. **Sensitive Action Protection**: Given a user with enabled 2FA, when they attempt sensitive account actions, then they must complete 2FA verification
7. **New Device Grace Period**: Given a user on a new device, when they log in for the first time, then they have a 24-hour grace period to set up 2FA
8. **Account Recovery**: Given a user who loses access to their 2FA method, when they initiate account recovery, then they can use backup codes or verified email recovery
9. **Error Handling**: Given a user entering an invalid 2FA code, when they submit the code, then they receive clear error messaging without revealing system information
10. **Security Compliance**: Given the MFA implementation, when security testing is performed, then all OWASP and industry security standards are met

## 5. Process & Rules
**Validated by SM:**

### Security Rules
- **Secret Management**: 2FA secrets must be encrypted using project-standard encryption
- **Rate Limiting**: SMS requests limited to 5 per hour, verification attempts limited to 10 per 15 minutes
- **Session Management**: 2FA verification must create secure session tokens
- **Backup Code Security**: Backup codes must be single-use and properly hashed

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: All MFA-related files must use `mfa_` or `two_factor_` prefix
- **Classes**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `TwoFactorAuthService`)
- **Methods**: camelCase describing action (e.g., `verifyTotpCode`, `generateBackupCodes`)
- **Variables**: descriptive camelCase following project standards

### Code Standards
- **Error Handling**: All MFA operations must have comprehensive error handling
- **Logging**: Security-relevant events must be logged for audit purposes
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and security tests required for all MFA components
- **Documentation**: Public APIs must have complete documentation
