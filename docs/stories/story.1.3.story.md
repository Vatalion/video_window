# Multi-Factor Authentication with Social Commerce Security

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Security & Trust Foundation

## Story
As a registered user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication using SMS, authenticator apps, or biometric verification, so that my account and social commerce activities (purchases, creator interactions, payment methods) are protected with enterprise-grade security while maintaining quick access to live shopping events.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Users need robust security for their social commerce activities without sacrificing convenience during time-sensitive live shopping events.
- **Solution**: Mobile-first MFA with biometric options, social commerce context awareness, and seamless integration with shopping flows.
- **Impact**: 60% reduction in account takeover incidents, 30% increase in user trust scores, 25% higher transaction completion rates, and protection of high-value creator-purchaser relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user in account settings, **When** they enable MFA, **Then** they can choose SMS, authenticator app, or biometric verification with 95% setup completion rate within 2 minutes
- [ ] **Given** a user enabling SMS MFA, **When** they enter their phone number, **Then** they receive verification codes within 30 seconds with 98% delivery rate and can complete setup
- [ ] **Given** a user enabling authenticator app MFA, **When** they scan the QR code, **Then** the app pairs successfully with 99% success rate and TOTP codes work within 3 seconds
- [ ] **Given** a user on mobile device, **When** they enable biometric MFA, **Then** Face ID/Touch ID authentication works with 98% success rate and <1 second response time
- [ ] **Given** a user with MFA enabled, **When** they perform high-risk actions (payment, profile changes), **Then** MFA verification triggers contextually with 90% user acceptance rate
- [ ] **Given** a user during live shopping events, **When** MFA is required, **Then** biometric verification is prioritized with <500ms response time to not miss shopping opportunities
- [ ] **Given** a user who loses MFA access, **When** they initiate recovery, **Then** backup codes or social recovery options restore access with 85% success rate within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Given** a new device login, **When** MFA verification is needed, **Then** a 24-hour grace period allows setup while maintaining security with 95% user compliance
- [ ] **Given** suspicious account activity, **When** automated detection triggers, **Then** step-up authentication activates with 99% accuracy and blocks fraudulent transactions
- [ ] **Given** MFA system monitoring, **When** security analytics run, **Then** 100% of MFA attempts are logged with real-time fraud detection and <0.1% false positive rate

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 60% reduction in account takeover incidents, 30% increase in user trust scores, 25% higher transaction completion rates
- **Technical Metric**: <3 second MFA verification time, 99.9% system uptime, 100% test coverage for security components
- **User Metric**: 90% user satisfaction with MFA experience, 85% MFA adoption rate among active users, 95% successful recovery rate

## Technical Requirements
- **Mobile-First Flutter Implementation**:
  - Biometric authentication integration (Face ID/Touch ID) with native secure storage
  - Touch-optimized MFA setup flows with gesture support
  - Offline capability for TOTP code generation
  - Camera access for QR code scanning with live preview
  - Push notifications for MFA alerts and recovery guidance
- **Social Commerce Security Integration**:
  - Contextual MFA triggering based on transaction value and risk assessment
  - Priority authentication during live shopping events
  - Creator-purchaser relationship protection mechanisms
  - Social proof verification for high-value transactions
  - Integration with payment and checkout flows
- **Performance & Security**:
  - MFA verification response time: <3 seconds for 95% of requests
  - Biometric authentication: <1 second response time with 98% success rate
  - SMS delivery: 98% success rate within 30 seconds
  - Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute per IP
  - Encrypted storage for all MFA secrets using platform secure storage
- **Compliance & Standards**:
  - SOC2, GDPR, CCPA compliance with audit trails
  - RFC 6238 compliance for TOTP implementation
  - OWASP security best practices implementation
  - Zero-trust security model for account protection

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Twilio SMS (phone verification), TOTP library (OTP package), Flutter Secure Storage, Local Authentication plugin, Story 1.1 authentication foundation
- **Business**: Security team for penetration testing, legal team for compliance validation, customer support for recovery procedures
- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (User Registration), Story 1.5 (Session Management), Story 5.0 (Payment Processing)

## Out of Scope
- Hardware token support (YubiKey, etc.)
- Advanced behavioral biometrics
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Third-party authenticator app ecosystem beyond standard TOTP
- Advanced fraud detection using AI/ML models

## Notes
- Biometric authentication provides seamless security for social commerce interactions while maintaining accessibility
- Contextual MFA triggering balances security with user experience during high-value live shopping moments
- Social recovery mechanisms leverage community trust while maintaining security standards
- Real-time fraud detection protects both users and creators in the social commerce ecosystem
- Mobile-optimized flows ensure MFA doesn't create friction during time-sensitive purchasing decisions
