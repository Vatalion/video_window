# Story 5.3: Social Sharing

## 1. Title
Cross-platform sharing system with customizable links, viral mechanics, and analytics for craft content distribution and community growth.

## 2. Context
**Background and Motivation:** This story addresses the critical need for strategic content distribution in the craft marketplace where creators rely on multi-platform presence to reach diverse audiences. Unlike generic social platforms, Video Window requires a sharing system purpose-built for craft content that emphasizes the creation journey, ensures proper creator attribution, and integrates commerce opportunities directly into shared content.

**Market Positioning:** The sharing system creates competitive advantage through:

- **Community Building**: Facilitates connections between creators with similar techniques and styles

**Competitive Analysis:**
- **Pinterest**: Focuses on collection and inspiration, lacks transactional integration
- **TikTok**: Optimized for entertainment virality, not craft-specific discovery
- **Instagram**: Broad social sharing without craft-tailored attribution systems
