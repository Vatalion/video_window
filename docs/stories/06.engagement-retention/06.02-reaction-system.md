# Multi-Emotion Reaction System with Real-Time Updates and Social Commerce Integration

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Engagement & Retention

## Story
As a craft creator or enthusiast,
I want to express nuanced emotional reactions to craft content with real-time updates, social commerce integration, and personalized engagement,
so that I can provide meaningful feedback, discover similar content, support creators financially, and build community through shared emotional experiences.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Simple like/dislike buttons limit emotional expression, content discovery, and creator monetization opportunities
- **Solution**: Multi-emotion reaction system with real-time updates, social commerce hooks, and habit-forming engagement mechanics
- **Impact**: 15% increase in content discovery, 25% improvement in creator retention, 2.8 reaction diversity per user, 12% increase in creator revenue from reaction-driven commerce

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Reaction Functionality
- [ ] **Given** a user is viewing craft content, **When** they tap a reaction button, **Then** their reaction is registered with <500ms response time, haptic feedback, and visual confirmation animation
- [ ] **Given** a user wants to change their reaction, **When** they select a different emotion, **Then** the previous reaction is replaced immediately with smooth transition animation and updated analytics
- [ ] **Given** multiple users are viewing content simultaneously, **When** reactions are added, **Then** counts update in real-time across all sessions with <1s latency and optimistic UI updates
- [ ] **Given** a user wants to see who reacted, **When** they tap a reaction count, **Then** they see reactor list with profile links, creator attribution, and respect for privacy settings
- [ ] **Given** a user has no network connectivity, **When** they react to content, **Then** reactions are queued locally and synchronized automatically when connectivity is restored

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** a user expresses "Support" or "Love" reaction, **When** commerce integration triggers, **Then** contextual tip options appear with 25% conversion rate and seamless checkout flow
- [ ] **Given** a user reacts with "Inspired" or "Want to Make", **When** reaction is processed, **Then** relevant craft materials and tools are recommended with 30% click-through rate
- [ ] **Given** a creator views reaction analytics, **When** they check conversion dashboard, **Then** they see revenue impact, audience insights, and product recommendations based on reaction patterns
- [ ] **Given** high-value reactions (Support, Love, Amazing), **When** threshold is reached, **Then** creator receives notification with celebration message and earnings summary

### Engagement and Gamification
- [ ] **Given** a user maintains reaction streak, **When** they complete daily reactions, **Then** they unlock exclusive reaction packs, badges, and creator perks with 70% retention rate
- [ ] **Given** trending content is displayed, **When** users browse by reactions, **Then** sentiment analysis shows popular content with 85% accuracy and personalized recommendations
- [ ] **Given** community reaction patterns, **When** viral content is detected, **Then** real-time notifications are sent to reactors with achievement celebrations and social sharing options
- [ ] **Given** reaction analytics are available, **When** users check their profile, **Then** they see personal reaction history, impact statistics, and discovery insights

- Create advanced haptic feedback system using `vibration` package with distinct patterns for each reaction type
- Design reaction streak system with daily engagement tracking and streak recovery mechanisms
- Implement reaction-based recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis

### Social Commerce Integration
- Build tip integration system with `stripe_flutter` for seamless payment processing from reaction triggers
- Create product recommendation API that maps reaction patterns to relevant craft materials and tools
- Implement creator earnings dashboard with real-time reaction revenue tracking
- Design affiliate link integration for reaction-driven product recommendations

### Mobile Optimization
- Ensure mobile-optimized touch targets (minimum 44x44 points) with gesture recognition
- Implement battery-efficient background synchronization using `workmanager` package
- Create adaptive UI for different screen sizes and orientations using `responsive_builder`
- Support biometric authentication using `local_auth` for sensitive reaction history and earnings access

### Security and Privacy
- Implement GDPR-compliant reaction data storage and processing
- Create granular privacy controls for reaction visibility and history
- Design fraud detection system for reaction manipulation prevention
- Implement rate limiting and abuse detection for reaction systems

## Dependencies
