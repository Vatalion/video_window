# Abandoned Cart Recovery with Social-Commerce Integration

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Engagement & Retention

## Story
As an e-commerce business owner,
I want to recover abandoned carts through targeted social-commerce campaigns with creator engagement,
so that I can maximize conversion rates, build community connections, and recover potentially lost revenue.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional abandoned cart recovery lacks social engagement and personalization, leading to low recovery rates
- **Solution**: AI-powered recovery system with creator voice notes, social proof, and community challenges
- **Impact**: 25% recovery rate for high-value carts, 40% faster recovery times, 15% increase in AOV

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Recovery Intelligence
- [ ] **Given** a cart is abandoned for 2+ hours with value >$50, **When** the system detects it, **Then** AI-powered scoring assigns recovery likelihood (85% accuracy) and prioritizes campaigns based on predicted LTV impact
- [ ] **Given** high-intent abandonment signals (prolonged cart view, multiple item comparisons), **When** detected within 30 minutes, **Then** immediate micro-campaign triggers with <5 minute response time achieving 40% conversion for high-intent users
- [ ] **Given** cart value fluctuates due to inventory changes, **When** price increases, **Then** proactive recovery campaigns offer price protection for 24 hours with 35% retention rate

### Multi-Channel Orchestration
- [ ] **Given** a recovery campaign is triggered, **When** messages are sent, **Then** multi-channel coordination achieves 25% recovery rate across email (40%), SMS (35%), push (20%), and in-app (5%) channels with automated channel preference optimization
- [ ] **Given** user has opted out of SMS, **When** campaign triggers, **Then** system automatically reroutes to preferred channels (email/push) within 2 minutes maintaining 90% delivery rate
- [ ] **Given** campaign delivery failures occur, **When** detected, **Then** automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff achieves 95% successful delivery within 4 hours

### Personalized Content & Creator Integration
- [ ] **Given** a user receives a recovery message, **When** they view it, **Then** personalized content includes creator voice notes with 60% engagement rate and <3 second load time on mobile networks
- [ ] **Given** user has previous creator interactions, **When** recovery message is sent, **Then** creator-specific personalization increases CTR by 45% compared to generic messages
- [ ] **Given** creator availability varies, **When** campaign schedules voice notes, **Then** intelligent scheduling respects creator time zones and achieves 90% voice note inclusion rate

### Timing Optimization & Behavioral Intelligence
- [ ] **Given** campaigns are scheduled, **When** they execute, **Then** AI-driven timing respects creator hours and user behavior with 40% faster recovery compared to fixed-time campaigns
- [ ] **Given** user behavior patterns indicate evening shopping preference, **When** abandonment occurs during day, **Then** recovery messages schedule for 7-9 PM achieving 55% higher engagement
- [ ] **Given** user has abandoned cart >3 times in month, **When** new abandonment occurs, **Then** extended cooling period (48 hours) reduces unsubscribe rate by 60%

### Dynamic Incentives & A/B Testing
- [ ] **Given** A/B tests are running, **When** they complete, **Then** statistical significance analysis (95% confidence) shows 15% conversion lift from winning variations with automated winner implementation
- [ ] **Given** dynamic incentives are generated, **When** users receive offers, **Then** personalized discounts achieve 20% redemption rate and 15% AOV increase with profit margin protection
- [ ] **Given** cart value varies, **When** incentives calculated, **Then** tiered discount strategy (5% for <$100, 10% for $100-$500, 15% for >$500) maximizes profit while maintaining 25% recovery rate

### Community & Social Proof
- [ ] **Given** creators trigger recovery campaigns, **When** they send personalized messages, **Then** community response shows 30% higher conversion than automated messages with creator attribution tracking
- [ ] **Given** social proof mechanics are active, **When** users view recovery messages, **Then** testimonials (25% higher trust) and community challenges (30% participation) drive combined 40% conversion lift
- [ ] **Given** urgency tactics are employed, **When** inventory is low, **Then** "X people have this in cart" messaging increases conversion by 35% without being deceptive
