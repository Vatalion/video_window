# Real-Time Notifications and Messaging with Behavioral Triggers

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Engagement & Retention
**Quality Score:** 9.2/10

## Story
As a craft creator or enthusiast,
I want to receive personalized notifications and engage in real-time messaging with behavioral triggers,
so that I can stay connected with my community, respond to opportunities quickly, and build meaningful relationships through timely, relevant communication.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Generic notification timing and lack of personalization lead to poor engagement (current industry average: 15-20% engagement rates), missed opportunities, and notification fatigue causing 30%+ opt-out rates
- **Solution**: AI-powered behavioral triggers with real-time messaging, social commerce integration, and intelligent delivery optimization
- **Impact**: 95%+ delivery rate, 3x higher retention for messaging users, 40% increase in response rates, 25% conversion lift from commerce notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
### Core Notification Effectiveness
- [ ] **Given** a user receives a critical notification (live shopping start, high-value purchase inquiry, urgent creator message), **When** it's delivered, **Then** it arrives within 5 seconds with 95%+ success rate and <1% false positive rate
- [ ] **Given** a user configures notification preferences, **When** they adjust settings, **Then** granular controls take immediate effect across all channels (push, in-app, email) with <100ms preference sync time
- [ ] **Given** behavioral triggers are active, **When** user patterns are detected (cart abandonment, browsing behavior, engagement patterns), **Then** AI-powered timing increases engagement by 40% compared to fixed-schedule notifications
- [ ] **Given** users are messaging, **When** they send craft media (videos, images, project files), **Then** real-time sync achieves <100ms latency with offline support and automatic retry on network recovery

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** commerce events occur (purchase, cart addition, price drop), **When** notifications trigger, **Then** purchase-related alerts achieve 25% conversion lift with deep links to relevant products/creators
- [ ] **Given** a creator starts a live shopping event, **When** followers are notified, **Then** event notifications achieve 35%+ attendance rate with personalized timing based on user behavior patterns
- [ ] **Given** a user receives a creator spotlight notification, **When** they engage, **Then** click-through rates increase by 30% compared to generic promotional notifications

### Intelligent Delivery & User Experience
- [ ] **Given** quiet hours are set, **When** notifications are queued, **Then** batching respects user preferences with 100% compliance and urgent messages (security, high-value opportunities) bypass quiet hours appropriately
- [ ] **Given** users search messages, **When** they use AI assistance, **Then** semantic search returns results in <1 second with 90% accuracy including commerce-related content and creator mentions
- [ ] **Given** notification fatigue is detected, **When** user engagement drops below threshold, **Then** automatic frequency adjustment increases engagement by 20% within 7 days

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Given** system load increases, **When** 10,000+ concurrent notifications are processed, **Then** system maintains <5 second delivery SLA with 99.9% uptime and automatic failover
- [ ] **Given** network connectivity issues, **When** messages are sent, **Then** offline queuing maintains message integrity with automatic sync on connection recovery and zero message loss
- [ ] **Given** security events occur, **When** authentication-related notifications are sent, **Then** delivery priority exceeds 99.5% with multi-channel fallback (push → SMS → email)
