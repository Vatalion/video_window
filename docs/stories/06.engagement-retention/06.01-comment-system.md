# Threaded Comment System with Rich Social Engagement

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** Engagement & Retention

## Story
As a craft creator or enthusiast,
I want to participate in threaded discussions with rich text formatting, media attachments, and social commerce integration,
so that I can share technical knowledge, collaborate on projects, build community around craft techniques, and drive product discovery through authentic engagement.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Limited engagement options prevent deep technical discussions, knowledge sharing, and organic product discovery among craft enthusiasts
- **Solution**: Real-time threaded commenting system with rich media support, social commerce integration, and community-building features
- **Impact**: 25% increase in conversion rates from comment interactions, 40% faster creator response times, 95% user satisfaction, 30% increase in session duration, 20% improvement in community retention

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** a user wants to add visual context, **When** they attach media, **Then** images, videos, and GIFs are uploaded with sanitization, compression, and size limits (15MB max for images, 50MB for videos)
- [ ] **Given** a user posted a comment, **When** they edit within 10 minutes, **Then** changes are saved with edit history tracking, version control, and visible edit timestamps
- [ ] **Given** a comment has shoppable products, **When** users interact with product stickers, **Then** 20% click-through rate to product pages is achieved with affiliate attribution

### Community Engagement Features
- [ ] **Given** a user is reading comments, **When** they engage with content, **Then** they can react with craft-specific emojis (🧵✂️🎨🔧) and see real-time reaction counts
- [ ] **Given** a creator posted content, **When** they respond to comments, **Then** their responses are highlighted with "Creator" badge and priority visibility
- [ ] **Given** users are discussing techniques, **When** they mention materials or tools, **Then** auto-complete suggests shoppable products with 85% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** a community member contributes valuable insights, **When** their comment receives engagement, **Then** they earn community recognition badges and expertise points
- [ ] **Given** users want to follow discussions, **When** they subscribe to comment threads, **Then** they receive push notifications for new replies with intelligent batching
- [ ] **Given** creators want to highlight community contributions, **When** they feature user comments, **Then** featured comments appear in a dedicated "Community Picks" section

### Social Commerce Integration
- [ ] **Given** a comment mentions craft materials, **When** the system detects product mentions, **Then** it automatically suggests relevant shoppable products with 75% match accuracy

- [ ] **Given** users engage with product-mentioning comments, **Then** the system tracks conversion attribution and reports ROI to creators

### Content Moderation & Safety
- [ ] **Given** users are posting comments, **When** potentially inappropriate content is detected, **Then** AI moderation flags content for review with <5% false positive rate
- [ ] **Given** community members encounter violations, **When** they report content, **Then** reports are processed within 1 hour with transparent resolution status
- [ ] **Given** creators are managing their community, **When** they moderate comments, **Then** they can set custom moderation rules and keyword filters
- [ ] **Given** users are discussing sensitive topics, **When** content requires age verification, **Then** appropriate age-gating is applied with COPPA compliance

### Mobile-First Experience
- [ ] **Given** users are on mobile devices, **When** they interact with comments, **Then** touch targets are at least 44x44px with haptic feedback
- [ ] **Given** users are scrolling through comments, **When** they reach the end, **Then** infinite scroll loads additional comments with <200ms latency
- [ ] **Given** users are typing comments, **When** they use mobile keyboards, **Then** craft-specific auto-complete and emoji suggestions appear above the keyboard
