# Story 3.1: Viewer Profile Management

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** viewer,
**I want** to create and manage my profile with avatar, privacy settings, and notification preferences,
**so that** I can personalize my experience and control my data privacy and communications

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete profile management interface with avatar/media upload, personal information editing, and real-time validation with optimistic updates and comprehensive error handling.
2. Secure media upload system with file validation, virus scanning, automatic resizing/compression, and secure CDN storage with signed URLs for privacy protection.
3. Granular privacy settings allowing viewers to control profile visibility, data sharing preferences, and consent management with GDPR/CCPA compliance and audit trails.
4. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive PII data encryption at rest and in transit with field-level encryption for sensitive profile data and secure key management.
5. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement data subject access request (DSAR) functionality allowing users to export, correct, and delete their personal information with audit logging.
6. **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Implement role-based access controls ensuring users can only modify their own profiles with proper authentication and authorization validation.
7. Notification preference matrix with granular controls for email, push, and in-app notifications with intelligent delivery and suppression based on user preferences.
8. Integration tests covering profile CRUD operations, privacy controls, media upload workflows, and comprehensive security testing including data access patterns.
