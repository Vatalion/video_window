# Integration Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a comprehensive integration management system,
**so that** I can configure, monitor, and manage third-party service integrations efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Third-party service configuration with connection testing and validation
2. API key and credential management with secure storage and rotation
3. Webhook configuration and testing with event filtering and retry policies
4. Integration monitoring and alerting with health checks and performance metrics
5. Integration testing tools for validating data flow and error handling
6. Integration version management and migration support
7. Integration dependency mapping and impact analysis
8. Integration analytics and usage reporting
9. Integration failure handling with automated recovery and escalation
10. Integration documentation and API specification management

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: tests/admin/integrations/
- Test standards: Integration tests, connection tests, webhook tests
- Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for E2E integration workflows
- Include tests for connection validation, webhook delivery, and error handling

### Relevant Source Tree
- Integration components: src/components/admin/integrations/
- Service management: src/services/admin/integrations/services/
- Webhooks: src/services/admin/integrations/webhooks/
- Monitoring: src/services/admin/integrations/monitoring/
- API endpoints: src/api/admin/integrations/

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Use React with TypeScript for integration management interface
- Implement secure credential storage with encryption
- Use Webhook management libraries for webhook handling
- Apply proper monitoring and logging for integrations
- Implement real-time status updates with WebSocket
- Use Web Workers for heavy integration processing
- Apply proper caching strategies for integration data
- Implement proper error handling for integration failures

### Architecture Integration
- Integration management follows backend architecture patterns
- Webhook handling follows external-apis.md patterns
- API endpoints follow rest-api-spec.md guidelines
- Component structure follows frontend-architecture.md
- Testing strategy follows testing-strategy.md requirements
