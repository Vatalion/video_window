# Story 4.6: Feed Personalization & User Preferences

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** viewer,
**I want** to adjust my feed preferences (auto-play, tags, blocked makers, captions),
**so that** the feed aligns with my comfort and accessibility needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Feed settings sheet allows toggling auto-play, captions, playback speed, preferred quality, and tag filters, persisting to Serverpod preferences. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]
2. Preferences update endpoint recalculates personalization configuration and returns effective settings plus algorithm being used. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#implementation-guide]
3. **ACCESSIBILITY CRITICAL**: Reduced motion preference turns off auto-play and enables static preview thumbnails; captions toggle persists for future videos. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#technology-stack]
4. UI surfaces blocked maker list with ability to add/remove; backend ensures blocked IDs excluded from subsequent feed responses. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#data-models]
5. Analytics event `feed_preferences_updated` fires with diff metadata and experiment variants, ensuring traceability in Segment. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#analytics--observability]

## Prerequisites
1. Story 4.1 – Home Feed Implementation
2. Story 4.2 – Infinite Scroll & Pagination
3. Story 4.5 – Content Recommendation Engine Integration

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Flutter
- [ ] Create `feed_settings_sheet.dart` with sections for playback, personalization, blocked makers, and accessibility options. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]
- [ ] Implement `update_feed_preferences_use_case.dart` to map form values to domain objects and call repository. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]
- [ ] Update `VideoFeedBloc` to refresh feed state when preferences change and to adjust preload strategy accordingly. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#implementation-guide]

### Serverpod
- [ ] Extend `feed_endpoint.dart` and `feed_service.dart` to persist `FeedConfiguration` entity, storing blocked makers and quality preferences. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]
- [ ] Update recommendation payloads to include user-configured tags and blocked makers. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#implementation-guide]

### Analytics & Compliance
- [ ] Emit Segment + Datadog events for preference updates, capturing diff, algorithm, and session IDs. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#analytics--observability]
- [ ] Ensure accessibility toggles recorded for WCAG reporting dashboard. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#success-criteria]

## Data Models
- `FeedConfiguration` entity persists user choices, including blocked makers and playback preferences. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#feed-configuration-entity]

## API Specifications
- `PUT /feed/preferences` accepts payload with playback + filtering settings and returns effective configuration. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#feed-endpoints]

## Component Specifications
- Preferences UI resides within `video_window_flutter/packages/features/timeline/lib/presentation/pages/feed_settings_sheet.dart`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]

## File Locations
- Repository implementation in `video_window_flutter/packages/core/lib/data/repositories/feed/feed_repository.dart`. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#source-tree--file-directives]

## Testing Requirements
- Widget: `feed_settings_sheet_test.dart` verifying toggles, validation, and analytics triggers.
- Unit: `update_feed_preferences_use_case_test.dart` ensuring payload mapping and caching.
- Integration: `feed_preferences_integration_test.dart` verifying backend persistence and blocked maker filtering.

## Technical Constraints
- Preferences changes should reflect in feed within 2 swipes (<1 second) after update. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#implementation-guide]
- Blocked maker list limited to 200 entries to prevent payload bloat. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md#data-models]
