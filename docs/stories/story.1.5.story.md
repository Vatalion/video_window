# Story 1.5: Session Management and Token Refresh

## 1. Title
Implement secure session management with automatic token refresh for continuous user access without repeated logins.

## 2. Context
This story builds upon the user authentication system established in Story 1.1 and the biometric authentication implemented in Story 1.4. As the application grows in complexity, users need seamless, secure session management that maintains their authentication state across app usage sessions while ensuring security through proper token lifecycle management. The current system lacks sophisticated session management, refresh token capabilities, and cross-device session synchronization.

## 3. Requirements
**Validated by PO:**
- JWT access tokens with configurable expiration times (15-60 minutes)
- Refresh token mechanism for automatic session renewal (7-30 days)
- Secure token storage in iOS Keychain
- Concurrent session management with device recognition
- Session timeout and automatic logout after inactivity (30 minutes)
- Session revocation capabilities for security events
- Cross-device session synchronization
- Session activity monitoring and alerts
- Secure session termination on logout
- Compliance with JWT security best practices (RS256 signature algorithm)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Validated by QA:**
1. **JWT Token Management**: Access tokens are generated with configurable expiration and stored securely in iOS Keychain
2. **Refresh Token System**: Refresh tokens automatically renew access tokens before expiration without user interaction
3. **Session Tracking**: System tracks concurrent sessions across multiple devices with unique device identification
4. **Session Timeout**: User sessions automatically terminate after 30 minutes of inactivity
5. **Session Revocation**: Administrators and users can revoke specific or all sessions on demand
6. **Cross-Device Sync**: Session state synchronizes across user devices in real-time
7. **Activity Monitoring**: System logs and monitors session activities for security analysis
8. **Security Compliance**: All token operations follow OAuth 2.0 and JWT security best practices
9. **Device Recognition**: System identifies and remembers trusted devices for streamlined access
10. **Termination Security**: All sessions are properly terminated and tokens invalidated on logout

## 5. Process & Rules
**Validated by SM:**
- **Naming Convention**: All session-related components prefixed with "Session" or "Token"
- **File Organization**: Session management code organized under `/lib/features/auth/` with clear separation of data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Testing Standards**: Unit tests for all services, widget tests for UI components, integration tests for token refresh flows
- **Security Requirements**: All tokens must be encrypted at rest and use RS256 signature algorithm
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network failures, token expiration, and security violations
- **Logging**: Detailed session activity logging for security auditing and debugging
- **Performance**: Token refresh operations must be non-blocking and invisible to users
- **Compliance**: Must pass security review and comply with OAuth 2.0 best practices

## 8. Notes

### Dev Handoff Notes
**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All requirements implemented and tested

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- Used RS256 signature algorithm for JWT tokens as specified in requirements

- Session timeout configured for 30 minutes of inactivity
- Implemented comprehensive security monitoring and alerting
- Cross-device session synchronization with conflict resolution
- Device recognition with trust scoring system

**Technical Implementation:**
- SessionManagementService handles session lifecycle, timeout, and revocation
