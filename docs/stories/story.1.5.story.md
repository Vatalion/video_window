# Session Management with Social Commerce Persistence

## Status
**Status:** Ready for Development
**Priority:** High
**Epic:** User Experience & Engagement Foundation

## Story
As a registered user, I want seamless session management across my devices with intelligent persistence of my social commerce activities, so that I can maintain continuous access to live shopping events, creator interactions, and shopping cart contents without repeated logins while ensuring enterprise-grade security.

## Business Value
- **Problem**: Users face session timeouts during critical live shopping moments, losing cart contents and missing creator interactions, while the business suffers from abandoned carts and disengaged users.
- **Solution**: Intelligent session management with social commerce context awareness, cross-device synchronization, and seamless persistence of shopping activities.
- **Impact**: 40% reduction in cart abandonment, 35% increase in live shopping event attendance, 50% improvement in user engagement, and enhanced trust through security-conscious session handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user logs in successfully, **When** the session is established, **Then** JWT access tokens and refresh tokens are generated with configurable expiration (15-60 min access, 7-30 days refresh) and stored securely in iOS Keychain/Android Keystore
- [ ] **Given** a user with active session, **When** access token expires, **Then** refresh mechanism automatically renews tokens without user interruption with 99% success rate within 500ms
- [ ] **Given** a user across multiple devices, **When** they interact with the platform, **Then** session state synchronizes in real-time with shopping cart contents, creator preferences, and live event status with 95% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** a user during live shopping events, **When** session management occurs, **Then** critical shopping activities persist with 99% reliability and <100ms interruption to prevent missing limited-time offers
- [ ] **Given** a user after 30 minutes of inactivity, **When** automatic timeout triggers, **Then** graceful session termination occurs with cart content preservation and push notification re-engagement with 85% recovery rate
- [ ] **Given** a user on new device, **When** they authenticate, **Then** device recognition establishes trusted status with intelligent session policies based on behavioral patterns with 90% accuracy
- [ ] **Given** suspicious session activity, **When** automated detection occurs, **Then** step-up authentication triggers with 99% accuracy while preserving legitimate user activities and cart contents
- [ ] **Given** a user initiating logout, **When** session termination occurs, **Then** all tokens are invalidated across devices with 100% reliability and optional cart save for next session
- [ ] **Given** session monitoring systems, **When** analytics are processed, **Then** real-time session health metrics show 99.9% uptime with <0.1% false positive security alerts
- [ ] **Given** mobile network conditions, **When** connectivity fluctuates, **Then** offline session management maintains core functionality with 85% capability and seamless re-sync with 95% data integrity

## Success Metrics
- **Business Metric**: 40% reduction in cart abandonment, 35% increase in live shopping attendance, 50% improvement in user engagement sessions
- **Technical Metric**: <500ms token refresh time, 99.9% session uptime, 100% token invalidation accuracy, <100ms session sync latency
- **User Metric**: 90% user satisfaction with session persistence, 85% reduction in login friction, 95% successful cross-device session continuity

## Technical Requirements
- **Mobile-First Flutter Implementation**:
  - Biometric authentication for seamless session re-establishment
  - Touch-optimized session management UI with gesture controls
  - Offline-first architecture for session persistence during network interruptions
  - Background session monitoring with efficient battery usage
  - Push notifications for session alerts and re-engagement campaigns
- **Social Commerce Session Integration**:
  - Shopping cart persistence across sessions with real-time sync
  - Creator interaction state preservation (follow status, chat history, preferences)
  - Live shopping event session continuity with context awareness
  - Social proof and recommendation persistence based on session behavior
  - Payment flow session management with abandoned cart recovery
- **Performance & Security**:
  - Token operations: <500ms response time for 95% of requests
  - Session synchronization: <100ms latency with 99% reliability
  - Concurrent session handling: 10,000+ simultaneous sessions
  - Encrypted token storage using platform secure storage
  - RS256 JWT signature algorithm with proper key management
- **Compliance & Monitoring**:
  - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect compliance
  - SOC2, GDPR, CCPA compliant session logging
  - Real-time session monitoring with anomaly detection
  - Comprehensive audit trails for session lifecycle events

## Dependencies
- **Technical**: Flutter Secure Storage, JWT package, WebSockets for real-time sync, Story 1.1 authentication foundation, Story 1.3 MFA integration
- **Business**: Security operations for monitoring, legal compliance for session data handling, customer support for session recovery procedures
- **Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 (User Registration), Story 1.3 (Multi-Factor Authentication), Story 4.0 (Shopping Cart Management)

## Out of Scope
- Advanced behavioral biometrics for session security
- Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Advanced session analytics using AI/ML
- Cross-platform session sharing with third-party applications
- Advanced fraud detection beyond standard security patterns
