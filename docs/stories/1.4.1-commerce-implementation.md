## Testing Strategy

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: 100% coverage for inventory calculations and forecasting algorithms
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end inventory management workflows
- **Real-time Testing**: WebSocket and real-time data consistency validation
- **Performance Testing**: Inventory operations under high concurrency
- **Security Testing**: Access controls and data privacy validation

### Testing Framework
- **Flutter Testing**: `flutter_test` with `mocktail` for service mocking
- **Real-time Testing**: WebSocket testing and real-time data validation
- **Integration Tests**: Serverpod client mocking for inventory endpoints
- **Performance Tests**: Concurrent inventory operation testing

### Test Scenarios
- Real-time inventory tracking and updates
- Stock level alerts and notifications
- Inventory forecasting and predictions
- Warehouse management integration
- Batch and lot tracking
- Return and damage tracking
- Multi-location inventory support
- Automated stock adjustment
- Supplier integration and sync

### Performance Testing
- High-frequency inventory updates
- Concurrent stock adjustments
- Large-scale inventory data processing
- Real-time notification performance
- Forecasting algorithm performance

### Security Testing
- Inventory data access controls
- Supplier integration security
- Audit trail completeness
- Data privacy compliance
- API endpoint security

## Success Metrics
- 100% test coverage for inventory components
- < 100ms real-time inventory update latency
- 99.9% inventory data accuracy
- Successful forecasting with > 85% accuracy
- Zero security vulnerabilities in inventory management

## Technical Requirements
- Use WebSocket for real-time inventory updates
- Implement proper concurrency control for stock adjustments
- Use Redis for caching inventory data
- Add proper transaction management for inventory operations
- Implement audit logging for all inventory changes

## Integration Points
- Real-time notification system
- Supplier management system
- Warehouse management system
- Order processing system
- Analytics and reporting service

## QA Findings (2025-02-14)
- Document is labelled **Approved** despite every task still being unchecked; readiness should drop back to Draft until implementation evidence exists.
- Requirements assume WebSocket infrastructure, Redis caching, and several backend services that are absent from the current Flutter client; the story needs a concrete plan for these dependencies or scoped MVP alternatives.

## QA Findings (2025-02-15)
- `pubspec.yaml` lacks packages for WebSocket streaming, Redis, or supplier integrations—the platform story still needs concrete Flutter/Dart dependencies or API contracts before engineers can begin.
- `lib/features` exposes only `{cart,device_management,profile,recovery,security,shipping}`; there is no inventory module or backend folder, so the referenced file paths (`lib/features/inventory/...`, `backend/services/...`) remain hypothetical.
- Leaving the status at **Approved** while every checklist item is unchecked makes it difficult to gauge readiness; please align the status with actual implementation progress or supply references to committed code.
