# Story 7.1: Maker Story Capture & Editing Tools

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** maker,
**I want to** capture, edit, and assemble videos with timeline controls and captioning tools,
**so that** I can create compelling product stories without leaving the app

## Acceptance Criteria
1. In-app video capture with multi-clip recording, exposure/focus controls, and secure local encryption of raw footage until upload completion.
2. Timeline editor with drag-to-reorder clips, split/trim functionality, frame-accurate preview transitions, and real-time performance optimization for mobile devices.
3. Caption editor with manual text input, styling options (font, size, position), time-synchronized display, and auto-save after each edit with conflict resolution.
4. Import pipeline supporting device gallery access with format validation (MP4, MOV, H.264), DRM content warnings, and secure temporary storage processing.
5. Draft autosave system with local encrypted storage, incremental sync to cloud, device conflict resolution, and recovery from interruption during editing.
6. Mobile performance optimization maintaining 60fps timeline scrubbing, memory-efficient video processing, background rendering, and adaptive quality for device capabilities.
7. Integration with content pipeline including metadata tagging, preview generation, publishing workflow handoff, and compliance with media protection standards.
8. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Ensure smooth timeline interaction with <100ms response time for trim/split operations and <500ms clip loading on mid-tier mobile devices.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No prior Epic 7 stories are recorded, so this is the foundational implementation for the maker studio suite. Performance and security patterns should be established for subsequent stories (7.2, 7.3). [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-7--maker-story-capture--editing-tools]

### Data Models
- Video clips stored with metadata (duration, resolution, encoding, encryption key) in local SQLite and synced to `story_service` via Serverpod. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#database-schema-excerpt]
- Timeline projects reference multiple clips with time-based positioning, caption tracks, and edit history for versioning and conflict resolution. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-7--maker-story-capture--editing-tools]
- Caption data includes text content, styling properties, timing information, and localization support for multiple languages. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#story-service]

### API Specifications
- `POST /media/upload` accepts encrypted video chunks with resumable upload support and returns processing job IDs. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#media-pipeline]
- `PUT /story/draft` saves timeline state with incremental diff updates and conflict resolution metadata. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#story-service]
- `GET /media/formats` returns supported video formats, size limits, and encoding recommendations for device optimization. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#media-pipeline]

### Component Specifications
- Flutter `maker_studio` module owns camera capture, timeline editor, caption editor, and draft management UX. [Source: architecture/story-component-mapping.md#epic-7--maker-story-capture--editing-tools]
- BLoC-based state management with separate BLoCs for capture, timeline, captions, and draft persistence. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#state-management]
- Use shared design system components and performance-optimized custom widgets for timeline rendering. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#design-system]

### File Locations
- UI and state code belong under `video_window/lib/features/maker_studio/` following clean architecture layers. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#source-tree]
- Tests mirror feature paths under `video_window/test/features/maker_studio/` including performance benchmarks. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Video capture and editing must work offline with local encryption and sync when connectivity is restored. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#security]
- **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Timeline operations must respond in <100ms with smooth 60fps scrubbing on mid-tier devices. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#mobile-performance-optimization]
- **SECURITY CRITICAL**: Raw footage must be encrypted at rest with platform-specific secure storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore). [Source: architecture/architecture.md#security]
- **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Memory usage must stay <500MB during editing with efficient streaming and cleanup. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#mobile-performance-optimization]
- Video processing must be interruptible and resumable with graceful handling of app backgrounding/foregrounding. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#media-pipeline]
- All editing actions must be tracked for analytics with performance metrics and error monitoring. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#analytics-instrumentation]

### Project Structure Notes
- Implementation aligns with unified package structure using `features/maker_studio/` for story creation tools. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#video-marketplace-unified-package-structure]
- Timeline editor will be a reusable component that can be extended for future editing features. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#component-reusability]

## Testing
- Follow the project testing pipeline by running `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test --no-pub` before submission. [Source: architecture/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Add performance benchmarks for timeline operations using `integration_test` package with frame time measurements. [Source: testing/performance/performance-testing-guide.md]
- Include widget tests for timeline gestures, caption editor styling, and camera capture controls with mock providers. [Source: architecture/front-end-architecture.md#testing-strategy-client]
