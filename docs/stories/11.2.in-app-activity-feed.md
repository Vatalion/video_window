# Story 11.2: In-App Activity Feed & Notification Center

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** user (viewer or maker),
**I want** to view all my notifications in an activity feed,
**so that** I can catch up on missed events and access notification details

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Activity feed displays all notifications in reverse chronological order with read/unread visual distinction (bold text, blue indicator).
2. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL**: Feed loads first 50 notifications within 500ms with infinite scroll pagination for older notifications.
3. Notification tiles show icon, title, body preview, timestamp, and tap to view full details or navigate to related content.
4. Unread badge count displayed on tab bar icon, updating in real-time when new notifications arrive.
5. "Mark all as read" action available in activity feed header, updating all unread notifications in single operation.
6. Individual notification tap marks as read, updates badge count, and navigates to relevant screen (story, auction, order).
7. **ACCESSIBILITY**: Activity feed meets WCAG 2.1 AA with semantic labels, proper focus order, and screen reader announcements for new notifications.

## Prerequisites
1. Story 11.1 – Push Notification Infrastructure (notification delivery system)
2. Story 1.1 – Implement Email OTP Sign-In (authenticated user context)
3. Story 4.1 – Home Feed Implementation (navigation structure with tabs)

## Dev Notes
- Use `flutter_local_notifications` for foreground notification display
- Consider implementing notification grouping by type for better UX
- Add analytics events for notification engagement (view, tap, dismiss)
- Implement notification expiry (e.g., remove notifications older than 90 days)
- Consider adding notification filters (all, unread, by type)
- Monitor notification load performance with timeline devtools
- Test with large notification counts (100+) to verify performance
- Implement proper error boundaries for notification rendering failures
