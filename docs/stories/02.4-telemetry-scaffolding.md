## User Story

**As a** data analyst,  
**I want** a unified telemetry pipeline,  
**So that** analytics events flow consistently across app and backend.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Client SDK Wrapper**
   - Normalize event names, properties, and user identifiers
   - Support event buffering for offline scenarios
   - Emit events to Serverpod analytics endpoint
   - Include session context (device, app version, user ID)

2. **Server Event Emission**
   - Serverpod emits structured events with consistent schema
   - Events include request ID, timestamp, user context
   - Integration with external analytics platform (e.g., Amplitude)

3. **Event Catalog**
   - Document standard events (screen_view, button_click, etc.)
   - Define event schemas with required/optional properties
   - Version tracking for schema changes
