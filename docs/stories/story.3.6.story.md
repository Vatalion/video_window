### Development Process
- **Phase Approach**: Implement in 3 phases (Core Algorithms → Cross-Domain Integration → Optimization)
- **Data-Driven Development**: All algorithms require baseline testing and validation
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each recommendation component delivered as independently testable units
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review with focus on algorithmic efficiency
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit → Integration → A/B Testing → Performance testing sequence

### Integration Rules
- **API Contracts**: All recommendation services must use defined API contracts with versioning
- **Data Consistency**: User preference data must remain consistent across all recommendation systems
- **Performance**: All recommendation operations must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Scalability**: System must handle growth in users, content, and recommendation complexity
- **Privacy**: All user data must be handled with proper privacy controls and consent

### Naming Conventions
- **File Structure**: Follow domain-based organization (`lib/features/recommendations/`, `backend/ml/recommendations/`)
- **Component Naming**: Use descriptive names with domain prefixes (`RecommendationEngine`, `PersonalizationService`)
- **API Endpoints**: Use RESTful conventions with domain prefixes (`/api/v1/recommendations/`, `/api/v1/personalization/`)
- **Database Tables**: Use underscore naming with domain prefixes (`user_preferences`, `recommendation_logs`)

### Quality Rules
- **Algorithm Validation**: All recommendation algorithms require A/B testing before production
- **Performance**: All recommendation operations must meet defined performance benchmarks
- **Testing**: Minimum 90% test coverage for all recommendation logic
- **Documentation**: All algorithms and models must be documented
- **Privacy**: Regular privacy reviews for all personalization features
