# Story 1.7 - User Profile System

## 1. Title
User Profile Management System - Create and manage user profile information, privacy controls, and notification preferences.

## 2. Context
This story establishes a comprehensive user profile management system that allows registered users to customize their account experience, control privacy settings, and manage their digital presence. The implementation builds upon the authentication foundation from Story 1.1 and integrates with device management from Story 1.8 for enhanced security. The profile system serves as a critical component for personalization across the application, supporting commerce features and user engagement through customizable notification preferences.

## 3. Requirements
**Explicit Requirements Validated by PO:**

- Users can upload and manage profile photos with automatic optimization
- Users can upload and manage cover images with aspect ratio validation
- Users can add and edit bio and description fields with character limits and formatting
- Users can manage social media links and website URLs with validation

### Privacy and Security Controls
- Users can configure detailed notification preferences (push, email, in-app)
- Users can control profile visibility settings (public, private, friends-only)
- Users can export their account data in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
- Users can delete their account with proper verification and data cleanup
- All profile changes require authentication verification and audit logging

### Integration Requirements
- Profile management integrates with device management from Story 1.8 for security
- Profile data supports commerce personalization features
- Notification preferences align with device-based notifications
