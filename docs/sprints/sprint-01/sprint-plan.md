## Team Capacity

### Available Capacity
- **Developer 1:** 20 story points
- **Developer 2:** 20 story points  
- **Developer 3:** 20 story points
- **Developer 4:** 20 story points
- **Total Available:** 80 story points

### Committed Capacity
- **Sprint 1 Commitment:** 13 story points (16% of capacity)
- **Buffer:** 67 story points (84% buffer for first sprint learning)

**Rationale:** Conservative first sprint to:
- Establish team velocity baseline
- Learn Melos/Serverpod workflow
- Validate story estimation accuracy
- Build team confidence

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- [ ] GitHub repository access configured for all team members
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed on all dev machines
- [ ] Flutter 3.19.6 / Dart 3.5.6 installed
- [ ] Melos globally activated

### Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Serverpod learning curve | Medium | Medium | Pair programming, reference Serverpod guides in docs/frameworks/serverpod/ |
| CI/CD configuration complexity | Low | High | Use existing templates, test incrementally |
| Team unfamiliar with Melos | Medium | Low | Run team training session, document in README |
| Pre-commit hook conflicts | Low | Low | Provide opt-out mechanism during debugging |
