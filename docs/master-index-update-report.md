- Added validation status column showing technical and story completion status
- Reorganized epics into logical groupings: Foundational, Core Feature, Post-MVP
- Added critical MVP gap warnings for Epics 8 & 13 (missing stories)

- Maintained existing epic descriptions and requirements (no functional changes)

**Key Improvements:**

- Proper process integration with validation workflows
- Current status transparency for stakeholders
- Maintained requirement integrity while improving governance

## Cross-Reference Validation

**Verified Consistency:**
- ✅ Epic numbering matches across tech-spec.md, PRD, and tech-spec-epic-*.md files
- ✅ File path references use correct non-padded format
- ✅ Validation status aligns with epic-validation-backlog.md
- ✅ Process references point to correct workflow documents
- ✅ Critical gap identification matches missing-stories-analysis.md findings

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Outcomes:**
- Master index documents now accurately reflect project state
- Clear identification of MVP development blockers
