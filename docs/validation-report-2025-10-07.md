## Quality Gates Assessment

### Technology and Library Decision Table
**Status:** ✗ FAIL - Missing specific versions in some areas
- Technologies mostly have versions (e.g., "Flutter 3.19+", "PostgreSQL 15.x")
- Some entries use "+" notation indicating version ranges rather than specific versions
- No vague entries detected
- Grouping is logical

### Proposed Source Tree
**Status:** ✗ FAIL - Incomplete
- High-level structure mentioned but detailed directory tree missing
- Monorepo structure documented but not fully specified

### Cohesion Check Results
**Status:** ✗ FAIL - Missing entirely
- No cohesion-check-report.md found
- No Epic Alignment Matrix
- No story readiness assessment
- No systematic validation of requirements coverage

### Design vs Code Balance
**Status:** ✓ PASS - Appropriate
- Architecture focuses on design patterns and structure
- No extensive code implementations found

---

## Failed Items

### Critical Blockers
1. **Missing analysis-template.md** - Cannot determine project level or readiness
2. **No project-workflow-analysis.md** - Essential for workflow progression
3. **Missing cohesion-check-report.md** - Critical validation artifact
4. **No Epic Alignment Matrix** - Required for requirements traceability
5. **Missing tech-spec-epic-*.md files** - Required for development handoff

### Important Gaps
1. **Project level undetermined** - Cannot assess appropriate workflow depth
2. **User skill level not assessed** - Cannot adapt outputs appropriately
3. **No systematic architecture evaluation** - Missing reference architecture comparison
4. **Incomplete specialist sections** - DevOps, Security, Testing need detailed treatment

---

## Partial Items

### Architecture Documentation
- **What's missing:** Source tree details, specialist sections, formal validation
- **Impact:** Developers may lack implementation guidance

### Technology Stack
- **What's missing:** Specific versions (some entries use ranges)
- **Impact:** Potential environment consistency issues

### UX Specifications
- **What's missing:** High-fidelity mockups, accessibility annotations
- **Impact:** UI implementation may lack pixel-perfect guidance

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical Blockers)
1. **Create analysis-template.md** - Run plan-project workflow to generate baseline analysis
2. **Generate project-workflow-analysis.md** - Essential for project tracking and workflow status
3. **Execute cohesion check** - Generate cohesion-check-report.md and Epic Alignment Matrix
4. **Create tech-spec files** - Generate tech-spec-epic-*.md for all 20 epics
5. **Determine project level** - Essential for workflow scoping (likely Level 2-3 based on complexity)

### Should Improve (Important Gaps)
1. **Assess user skill level** - Adapt all documentation outputs appropriately
2. **Complete architecture sections** - Add DevOps, Security, Testing specialist sections
3. **Detail source tree structure** - Provide complete directory layout
4. **Formal architecture evaluation** - Document reference architecture comparison and selection rationale

### Consider (Minor Improvements)
1. **Pin specific technology versions** - Replace version ranges with exact versions
2. **Add UX handoff documentation** - Complete wireframe-to-asset pipeline
3. **Create development setup guide** - Supplement architecture with onboarding instructions

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. **Run plan-project workflow** to generate missing analysis documents
2. **Execute solution-architecture workflow** completely to generate all required outputs
3. **Validate all outputs** against current checklist before proceeding to development

### After Fixing Blockers
1. **Schedule development kickoff** once all critical artifacts are in place
2. **Review architecture with technical team** for implementation feasibility
3. **Set up development environment** based on finalized architecture specifications

---

**Overall Assessment:** The project has strong foundational documents (PRD, architecture) but is missing critical workflow artifacts required for development readiness. The architecture demonstrates thoughtful technical decisions, but the lack of systematic validation and specialist sections creates implementation risk.

**Recommendation:** Do not begin development until critical blockers are resolved and project readiness reaches ≥90%.
