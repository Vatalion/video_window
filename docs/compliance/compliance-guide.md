        keychain[token] = token
    }
}
```

<application
    android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config">

// Encrypted SharedPreferences
class SecureStorage(context: Context) {
    private val masterKey = MasterKey.Builder(context)
        .setKeyScheme(MasterKey.KeyScheme.AES256_GCM)
        .build()

    private val sharedPreferences = EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(
        context,
        "secure_prefs",
        masterKey,
        EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256_SIV,
