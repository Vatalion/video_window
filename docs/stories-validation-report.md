## Identified Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issue #1: Status Format Inconsistency ⚠️
**Issue:** Story 01.1 uses detailed approval tracking format while others use simple status

**Analysis:** Story 01.1 appears to be following an older governance template with explicit stakeholder approval tracking

**Recommendation:** Standardize on simple "Ready for Dev" format since:
1. Stakeholder approval is now tracked at epic level (epic-validation-backlog.md)
2. Story-level approval creates redundant governance overhead
3. 98% of stories already use simple format

**Action:** Update Story 01.1 status format to match others

### Enhancement Opportunity: Status Value Standards
**Current:** "Ready for Dev" (40 stories), "Ready for Review" (1 story)
**Recommendation:** Standardize on Definition of Ready-aligned statuses:
- "Draft" - Story being written
- "Ready for Review" - Story complete, awaiting approval
- "Approved" - Story approved and ready for sprint planning
- "In Progress" - Story in active development
- "Done" - Story completed and validated

## Corrective Actions Applied

### 1. Story 01.1 Status Format Standardization
Update Story 01.1 to use consistent status format:

```markdown
## Status
Ready for Dev
```

Remove redundant approval tracking (covered by epic-level governance).

### 2. Process Documentation Update
Document standard story status values in process documents for future consistency.
