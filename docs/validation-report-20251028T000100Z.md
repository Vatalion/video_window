## Completed Items
- Definitive tech spec for Epic 2 with pinned stack, environment configuration, source tree, implementation guide, monitoring plan, and test traceability.
- Story suite 2.1–2.4 authored with spec references, acceptance criteria, tasks, and change logs.
- Workflow artifacts present: `docs/tech-spec.md`, `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`, and active workflow path `docs/workflow-paths/epic-12.yaml`.
- Validation checklist re-run producing 36/36 passing results.

## Recommendations
1. Re-run `*validation-check epic-2` after any future modifications to maintain compliance.
2. Move to implementation planning with confidence that Epic 2 documentation is definitive and executable.
