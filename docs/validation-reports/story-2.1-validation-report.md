## Definition of Ready Validation

### 1. Business Requirements ✓ (4/4 PASS)

✅ **Clear user story format:** "As a marketplace administrator, I want to issue secure invitations that guide qualified makers through onboarding, so that only verified makers can claim accounts and gain maker capabilities safely"  
✅ **Explicit business value:** Controlled maker access through invitation-only system ensures quality and security  
✅ **Priority assigned:** Implicit P0 (critical for maker platform, prerequisite for all maker flows)  
✅ **Product Manager approval:** Status "Ready for Dev" indicates approval

### 2. Acceptance Criteria ✓ (5/5 PASS)

✅ **Numbered and specific:** 5 ACs numbered 1-5, each testable with clear technical specifications

- AC 1-5: All include source citations to tech spec sections
- Tasks section: Multiple source citations for implementation guidance
- Technical Constraints: "Device metadata captured during claim must be persisted for device trust calculations in Story 2.4"

### 9. Approvals & Sign-offs ✓ (3/4 PASS - MINOR GAP)

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED - READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (pending formal QA review)**

### Strengths
1. **Exceptional Security Focus:** SECURITY CRITICAL AC with cryptographically secure randomness, HMAC-SHA256 signing, single-use enforcement, brute-force alerts
2. **Comprehensive Auditability:** AC 5 ensures all invitation lifecycle events stream to audit topic with correlation IDs for compliance
3. **Clear RBAC Integration:** Permission-based invitation creation with `invitations.create` permission enforced via middleware
4. **Robust Rate Limiting:** Multi-layer rate limiting (5 attempts/hour per user, Redis-backed enforcement)
5. **Excellent Task Breakdown:** 13 granular tasks across 4 phases with AC mappings and source citations

### Areas of Excellence
- **Invitation Security:** HMAC-SHA256 signing, single-use enforcement, immediate invalidation after claim
