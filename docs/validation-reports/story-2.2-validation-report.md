### Key Validation Points

**Business Requirements:**
- Clear user story: "As a platform security administrator, I want granular roles and permissions enforced...so that makers and admins only access capabilities aligned with their responsibilities"
- Explicit business value: Security through least-privilege access control
- Status "Ready for Dev" indicates PM approval

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 5 ACs with clear technical specifications (role hierarchy, Redis caching, JWT claims, admin UI, audit logging)
- AC 5 flagged as SECURITY CRITICAL (audit table + streaming events for compliance)
- Measurable outcomes: 1-hour cache TTL, 5-second cache invalidation, >5 role changes/10min alert threshold

**Technical Clarity:**
- 11+ source citations to tech-spec-epic-2.md
- Clear API contracts (5 endpoints for role/permission management)
- Precise file locations (repositories, services, admin UI, BLoCs, tests)
- Redis caching with Postgres fallback, JWT claim propagation, Serverpod middleware enforcement

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests (role resolution, cache invalidation, middleware, BLoC)
- Integration tests (role assignment, JWT propagation, permission denials)
- Security tests (privilege escalation attempts)
- Implicit ≥80% coverage target (consistent with other stories)

**Tasks:** 10 granular subtasks across 4 phases (Data Layer, Service & Middleware, Admin UI, Audit & Observability) with AC mappings

**Minor Gap:** QA Results section not completed (consistent with Stories 1.3, 1.4, 2.1)

### Strengths
1. **Security-First Design:** SECURITY CRITICAL audit logging with streaming events, role hierarchy with inheritance
2. **Performance Optimization:** Redis caching (1hr TTL) with Postgres fallback, 5-second invalidation SLA
3. **JWT Integration:** Role/permission claims embedded in tokens for efficient authorization
4. **Privilege Escalation Detection:** Alert on >5 role changes/10min by same actor
5. **Clear RBAC Model:** Role hierarchy (`basic_maker`, `maker_admin`, `operations_support`) with inheritance

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **Approve for Sprint Planning** (97% DoR compliance)
2. **Complete QA Review:** Request Quinn (Test Architect) review
3. **Estimate Story Points:** 8-13 points (RBAC middleware + caching + audit streaming)
4. **Sprint Assignment:** Sprint 2 (depends on Stories 2.1, 1.3)

**Validation Complete:** Story 2.2 validated and APPROVED for development.
