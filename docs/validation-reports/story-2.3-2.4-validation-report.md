### Key Validation Points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 5 ACs with Persona integration, S3/KMS encrypted storage, webhook processing, compliance dashboard
- AC 4 SECURITY CRITICAL: 15-min token expiry, reuse detection, security alerts, manual review lockout
- Measurable outcomes: 50 MB file size limit, SHA-256 hashing, CSV export capability

**Technical Clarity:**
- 11+ source citations to tech-spec-epic-2.md
- Clear integration with Persona KYC service, S3/KMS encryption (`alias/video-window-maker-docs`)
- 3 API endpoints specified (upload, submit, webhook)

**Security & Compliance:**
- AES-256 encryption with KMS-managed keys, SHA-256 document hashing for tamper detection
- 15-minute verification token expiry with reuse detection
- Comprehensive audit trail with CSV export for compliance officers
- Quarterly key rotation policy (key alias usage prevents hard-coding)

**Tasks:** 12 granular subtasks across 4 phases (Persona Session, Document Handling, Webhook Processing, Compliance Dashboard) with AC mappings

**Minor Gap:** QA Results section not completed (consistent pattern)

### Strengths
1. **Persona Integration:** Industry-standard KYC service with session orchestration, status polling

4. **Compliance Features:** Dashboard with filters, CSV export, quick actions for additional info requests
5. **Notification System:** Email + in-app toast for verification state changes

### Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ **Approve for Sprint Planning** (97% DoR compliance)
2. **Complete QA Review:** Request Quinn (Test Architect) review
3. **Estimate Story Points:** 8-13 points (Persona integration + S3/KMS + webhook security)
4. **Sprint Assignment:** Sprint 2 (depends on Story 2.1, critical for maker trust)

### Key Validation Points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 5 ACs with profile management, device registry, trust scoring, admin alerts, audit streaming
- AC 3 SECURITY CRITICAL: Device attestation with platform/OS/jailbreak detection, risk scoring, access blocking
- Measurable outcomes: trust_score < 30 threshold, >3 revocations/day alert, <150ms device list latency

**Technical Clarity:**
- 10+ source citations to tech-spec-epic-2.md
- Clear device attestation requirements (platform, OS version, jailbreak/root status)
- 5 API endpoints specified (profile CRUD, device listing/registration/revocation)
- Device trust scoring configuration via `security/device-risk-profile.yaml`

**Security Features:**
- Device attestation metadata collection and trust scoring
- Revocation invalidates sessions and refresh tokens on target device
- PagerDuty alerts on trust_score <30 or >3 revocations/day
- Encrypted profile fields using same KMS CMK as KYC documents

**Tasks:** 9 granular subtasks across 3 phases (Profile Management, Device Registry & Trust Scoring, Alerts & Observability) with AC mappings

**Minor Gap:** QA Results section not completed (consistent pattern)

### Strengths
1. **Device Trust Scoring:** Risk-based access control with configurable thresholds
2. **Session Integration:** Device revocation invalidates sessions/refresh tokens (integrates with Story 1.3)
3. **Security Monitoring:** PagerDuty alerts on high-risk device events
4. **Profile Encryption:** KMS-managed encryption for sensitive fields (tax info, payout preferences)
5. **Audit Compliance:** Device events stream to audit topics with correlation IDs

### Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ **Approve for Sprint Planning** (97% DoR compliance)
2. **Complete QA Review:** Request Quinn (Test Architect) review
3. **Estimate Story Points:** 8-13 points (device attestation + trust scoring + session revocation integration)
4. **Sprint Assignment:** Sprint 2-3 (depends on Stories 2.1, 2.3, 1.3)
