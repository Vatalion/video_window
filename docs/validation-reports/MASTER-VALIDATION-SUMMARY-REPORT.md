‚ö†Ô∏è **Story Points Missing:** No explicit estimates (though task breakdowns enable sizing)

**Impact:** MINOR - Does not block development, addressed through recommendations

---

## Part 3: Critical Findings & Resolutions

### Epic 8 & 13 Story Gap (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

**Initial Finding (from tech-spec.md validation):**
- Epic 8 (Story Publishing): Flagged as "CRITICAL - No Stories"
- Epic 13 (Shipping & Tracking): Flagged as "CRITICAL - No Stories"

**Investigation:**
- Story files exist: 8.1-8.4 (4 stories) and 13.1-13.4 (4 stories)
- All 8 stories validated and APPROVED (97% avg DoR compliance)
- Tech spec index flagging was documentation discrepancy, not actual gap

**Resolution:**
‚úÖ Gap RESOLVED - Story files exist and validated  
‚úÖ Tech spec index needs update to reflect story file existence  
‚úÖ No blockers for MVP development

### Epic 02 Technical Spec (INFORMATIONAL)

**Finding:** Tech spec index lists foundational Epic 02 (Core Platform Services) but dedicated tech spec file doesn't exist.

**Context:** Current `tech-spec-epic-2.md` contains feature Epic 2 (Maker Authentication), not foundational Epic 02.

**Recommendation:** Create separate `tech-spec-epic-02.md` for Core Platform Services to avoid confusion.

**Impact:** LOW - Informational only, does not block MVP development

---

## Part 4: Architecture & Security Validation

- Global state in `video_window_flutter/lib/presentation/bloc/`
- Feature BLoCs in `packages/features/<feature>/lib/presentation/bloc/`
- NO GetIt globals - constructor injection only

**Data Layer:**
- Centralized in `packages/core/lib/data/repositories/`
- Feature packages contain ONLY `use_cases/` and `presentation/` layers

- Token manipulation resistance (signature forgery, claim modification)
- Session hijacking resistance (token reuse, device binding)
- OTP interception resistance (hashed storage, expiration)
- Privilege escalation attempts (RBAC enforcement)
- Payment security (webhook signature validation, no PAN handling)
- Video security (watermarking, capture deterrence, signed URLs)

**Security Compliance:**
- GDPR/CCPA compliance (DSAR workflows documented)
- PCI DSS SAQ A scoped (hosted Stripe Checkout, no PAN handling)
