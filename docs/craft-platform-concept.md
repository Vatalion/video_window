# Craft Stream Platform Concept & Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Product Vision**: A TikTok-style short-form video platform exclusively for makers, DIY creators, and inventors that transforms every project into a richly documented story and enables direct monetization of both creations and the tools used to build them.
- **Core Differentiators**: Craft-only content, narrative-rich detail pages, community-driven auctions, and dual monetization (finished goods + instruments/materials).
- **Strategic Imperative**: Bridge inspiration and transaction by connecting viewers with the full journey of handcrafted objects and giving them immediate paths to purchase, bid, or learn more.

## 2. Background & Source Inputs
- **Brainstorming Session (2025-09-15)**: Generated >25 ideas using What-If scenarios, Yes-And building, and mind mapping. Identified two-tier content systems, virtual storefronts, and craft tourism as standout themes.
- **Implementation Gap Analysis (2025-09-15)**: Highlighted missing business model clarity, technical architecture details, content pipeline design, go-to-market strategy, legal compliance, operations, competitive research, and analytics planning.
- **New Concept Additions (Current Conversation)**: Detailed TikTok-like scrolling behavior, deep-dive artifact pages, auction triggers from the detail view with timeline indicators, and emphasis on storytelling from inception to completion.
