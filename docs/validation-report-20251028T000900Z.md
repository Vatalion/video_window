## Remediation Notes
- Tech spec upgraded to Definitive v0.5 with pinned stack, source directives, implementation phases, monitoring plan, environment configuration, and test traceability.
- Authored Stories 12.1–12.4 with ACs, tasks, Dev Notes, and testing tied to spec.
- Added supporting docs `docs/analytics/stripe-payments-dashboard.md` and `docs/runbooks/stripe-payments.md` referenced in Monitoring & Implementation sections.
- Updated workflow artifacts (`docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`, `docs/workflow-paths/epic-12.yaml`) to guide validation rerun.

## Recommendations
1. Execute `*validation-check epic-12` to confirm automation passes.
2. Coordinate with Epic 13 team on order integration dependencies before implementation start.
