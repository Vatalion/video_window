### 1.1 Core Business Requirements Alignment ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Strengths:**
- **Clear value proposition**: The PRD and brief are perfectly aligned on the core concept of video-first artisan marketplace with transparent auction mechanics
- **Well-defined target users**: Both documents clearly identify makers (25-45, $1K-$10K/month) and buyers (28-55, $60K+ income) with specific needs
- **Consistent business model**: 5% commission structure, Stripe integration, and 72-hour auction rules are consistent across all documents

**Assessment Score: 9.2/10**

### 1.2 Feature Completeness & Business Logic ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**

1. **Missing business rules documentation**: Complex auction mechanics (soft-close extensions, minimum bid calculations) lack detailed business rule specifications
2. **Incomplete seller journey**: Limited documentation on maker onboarding, verification process, and business setup requirements
