## Quality Gates & Automation

### Automated Quality Gates (Must Pass)
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline green:** All automated checks passing
- [ ] **Code coverage threshold:** ≥80% coverage for new code
- [ ] **Security scan clean:** No critical security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] **Performance regression check:** No significant performance degradation
- [ ] **Accessibility automation:** Automated accessibility checks passing

### Manual Quality Gates (Must Complete)
- [ ] **Peer code review:** At least one approval from experienced team member
- [ ] **QA sign-off:** Testing team validates acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Product Manager acceptance:** Business stakeholder approves delivered value
- [ ] **Architecture review:** Complex changes reviewed by architect (if applicable)

## Story Status Progression

Stories progress through the following completion states:

1. **InProgress** - Story actively being implemented
2. **Ready for QA** - Development complete, awaiting quality validation
3. **QA In Progress** - QA team actively testing the story
4. **Ready for Review** - QA complete, awaiting final stakeholder acceptance
5. **Done** - All DoD criteria met, story complete and potentially shippable

**Important:** Only stories meeting ALL DoD criteria may be marked **"Done"**.

---

## Exception Process

In exceptional circumstances, a story may be marked "Done" without meeting all DoD criteria:

### Acceptable Exceptions
1. **Hotfix/Emergency:** Critical production fixes may have reduced testing requirements with PM + Architect approval
2. **Technical Debt Stories:** Pure refactoring work may have reduced UX validation requirements
3. **Infrastructure Work:** Backend-only changes may skip some UI-related criteria

### Exception Requirements
- **Must be documented:** "DoD Exception" label with rationale
- **Must have approvals:** Product Manager AND appropriate technical lead approval
- **Must have mitigation plan:** Plan for addressing skipped criteria in future work
- **Must be time-limited:** Exceptions reviewed and resolved within one sprint

2. Verify automated tests cover the implemented functionality
3. Check accessibility, performance, and cross-platform compatibility
4. Update story status to "Ready for Review" when QA complete

### During Final Review (Product Manager)
