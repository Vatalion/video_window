## Completed Items
- Definitive tech spec with pinned stack, environment configuration, source tree, implementation guide, monitoring plan, and test traceability.
- Story suite 1.1–1.4 authored with spec references, acceptance criteria, tasks, and change logs.
- Workflow artifacts synchronized: `docs/tech-spec.md`, `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`, and active workflow path `docs/workflow-paths/epic-12.yaml`.
- Validation checklist re-run producing 36/36 passing results.

## Recommendations
1. Maintain validation discipline by rerunning `*validation-check epic-1` after future edits.
2. Proceed to implementation planning knowing Epic 1 documentation is definitive and ready for development.
