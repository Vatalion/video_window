## Critical Issues Found and Resolved

### Before Refinement:
1. **Developer-Focused Perspective**: Stories were written for system administrators and engineers
2. **Generic Commerce Context**: Lacked social commerce and community features
3. **Missing Mobile Optimization**: No Flutter-specific requirements or mobile-first design
4. **Vague Success Metrics**: Business outcomes were not measurable or specific
5. **Template Non-Compliance**: Stories didn't follow the standardized BMad Method format

### After Refinement:
1. ✅ **User-Centric Focus**: All stories now written for mobile commerce creators
2. ✅ **Social Commerce Integration**: Live commerce, community features, creator tools included
3. ✅ **Mobile-First Design**: Flutter packages, biometric integration, offline capabilities
4. ✅ **Measurable Outcomes**: Specific business, technical, and user metrics with targets
5. ✅ **Template Compliance**: All stories follow exact BMad Method template structure

## Quality Gates Assessment

### ✅ Value Assessment
- **User Value**: All stories deliver clear value to mobile commerce creators
- **Business Value**: Specific revenue and engagement outcomes defined
- **Platform Alignment**: All stories support social commerce strategy
- **Measurable Impact**: Success metrics are quantifiable and trackable

### ✅ Implementation Assessment
