## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Serverpod Integration Complexity
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** 
- Serverpod integration guides already created (6 docs)
- Architecture team available for pairing
- Time buffer built into Story 01.1 estimate

### Risk 2: Veterans Day Holiday Impact
**Probability:** High  
**Impact:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Critical work scheduled before Nov 11
- Stories 01.2-01.4 can proceed with reduced capacity
- No hard dependencies on single developer

### Risk 3: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Issues
**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- GitHub Actions well-documented
- Similar pipelines exist in team's experience
- Can leverage community templates
