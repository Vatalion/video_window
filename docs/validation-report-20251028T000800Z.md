✓ PASS – Source tree validated.

## Remediation Notes
- Added analytics dashboard `docs/analytics/auction-timer-dashboard.md` and runbook `docs/runbooks/auction-timer.md`, referenced in Monitoring & Implementation sections.
- Upgraded tech spec to Definitive v0.5 with pinned stack, source directives, implementation steps, monitoring plan, environment config, and test traceability.
- Authored Story 10.2–10.4 and aligned all stories with acceptance criteria, tasks, dev notes, and testing guidance tied to spec sections.
- Updated workflow artifacts (`docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`, `docs/workflow-paths/epic-10.yaml`) to reflect remediation progress and next actions.

## Recommendations
1. Proceed to rerun the Epic 10 validation automation using `workflow-paths/epic-10.yaml` to confirm checklist state.
2. Begin implementation once validation pipeline passes and dependencies from Epic 9 remain stable.
