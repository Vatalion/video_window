## 2. Risk Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Risk Identification Process

#### **Continuous Identification Sources**

- **Technical Reviews**: Architecture and code review findings
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive and market risk monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Data-driven risk identification

#### **Structured Risk Assessment Sessions**
- **Weekly Team Risk Review**: 15 minutes during sprint retrospective
- **Monthly Formal Risk Assessment**: 1 hour dedicated session
- **Quarterly Strategic Risk Review**: 2 hours with stakeholders
- **Ad-Hoc Risk Sessions**: As needed for emerging risks

### 2.2 Risk Evaluation Matrix

#### **Impact Assessment Scale**

| Impact Level | Description | Criteria |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical (5)** | Project failure, severe financial loss, safety issues | Timeline > 4 weeks delay, budget > 25% overrun, regulatory violations |
| **High (4)** | Major impact on project objectives | Timeline 2-4 weeks delay, budget 15-25% overrun, major user impact |
| **Medium (3)** | Moderate impact, can be managed | Timeline 1-2 weeks delay, budget 5-15% overrun, some user impact |
| **Low (2)** | Minor impact, easily managed | Timeline < 1 week delay, budget < 5% overrun, minimal user impact |
| **Negligible (1)** | Little to no impact | No timeline/budget impact, no user impact |

#### **Probability Assessment Scale**

| Probability | Description | Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Very Likely (5)** | >80% chance of occurrence | Based on historical data, current trends |
| **Likely (4)** | 60-80% chance of occurrence | Evidence suggests high probability |
| **Possible (3)** | 40-60% chance of occurrence | Reasonable chance of occurrence |
| **Unlikely (2)** | 20-40% chance of occurrence | Low probability but possible |
| **Very Unlikely (1)** | <20% chance of occurrence | Rare circumstances required |

#### **Risk Score Calculation**

**Risk Score = Impact × Probability**

| Score Range | Risk Level | Response Time |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **16-25** | Critical | Immediate action (24 hours) |
| **9-15** | High | Prompt action (1 week) |
| **4-8** | Medium | Planned action (2-4 weeks) |
| **1-3** | Low | Monitor and accept |
