## 2. Daily Communication Rhythm

### 2.1 Daily Standup Protocol

#### **Meeting Details**

- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Format**: Standing meeting (in-person or video)
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master
- **Location**: Team room / Zoom link

#### **Standup Structure**
Each team member answers three questions:

1. **What I accomplished yesterday**
   - Focus on completed tasks toward sprint goal
   - Mention blockers that were resolved
   - Keep it concise and specific

2. **What I plan to accomplish today**
   - Commit to specific tasks for the day
   - Identify potential blockers
   - Request help if needed

3. **Impediments or blockers**
   - Clearly state what's blocking progress
   - Specify who needs to be involved
   - Escalate to parking lot for follow-up

#### **Guidelines and Rules**
- **Be on time**: Start exactly at 9:00 AM
- **Stand up**: Keep meeting brief and focused
- **No problem solving**: Use parking lot for detailed discussions
- **Focus on sprint goal**: Align daily work with sprint objectives
- **Listen actively**: Pay attention to team members' updates

#### **Sample Standup Format**
```
[Name]: Yesterday I completed the user authentication API integration
and resolved the token refresh issue. Today I'll work on implementing
the password reset feature. I'm blocked waiting for the API documentation
from the backend team.

[SM]: Got it. I'll follow up with the backend team after standup
to get you the documentation.
```
