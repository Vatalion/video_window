## Story Testing Validation Process

### **During Story Creation**
1. **Author identifies testing needs** based on story scope and impact
2. **Reference Master Test Strategy** for testing requirements by category
3. **Use appropriate template** from above based on story type
4. **Specify concrete testing criteria** with measurable outcomes

### **During Definition of Ready Review**
1. **Test Lead reviews** testing requirements for completeness
2. **Validates testing approach** aligns with Master Test Strategy
3. **Confirms testability** of acceptance criteria
4. **Approves testing strategy** before story marked "Ready"

### **During Implementation**
1. **Developer implements tests** according to specified requirements
2. **Tests must pass** before story marked "Ready for QA"
3. **QA validates** test coverage and execution
4. **Test results documented** in story completion

## Common Testing Gaps to Avoid

### **Insufficient Security Testing**
❌ **Gap:** "Test login functionality"
✅ **Correct:** "Test login with invalid OTP attempts, account lockout, session hijacking resistance, token expiration"

### **Vague Performance Requirements**
❌ **Gap:** "Test app performance"
✅ **Correct:** "App cold start ≤2.5s (p50), feed scroll 60fps with ≤2% jank, API responses ≤200ms"

### **Missing Integration Testing**
❌ **Gap:** "Unit test payment logic"
✅ **Correct:** "Unit test payment logic + integration test Stripe webhook handling + e2e test complete payment flow"

### **Inadequate Error Scenario Coverage**
❌ **Gap:** "Test successful story creation"
✅ **Correct:** "Test story creation with network failures, storage errors, validation failures, concurrent editing"

- [ ] Security requirements match security-critical story designation
- [ ] Performance targets align with platform performance standards
- [ ] Mobile-specific testing included for UI/UX work

### **Feasibility Check ✓**
