## Testing Philosophy & Principles

### Core Testing Principles
1. **Risk-Based Testing:** Test depth scales with business and technical impact
2. **Shift-Left Approach:** Catch defects early in development lifecycle
3. **Pyramid Priority:** Unit tests form foundation, integration tests verify interfaces, e2e tests validate critical flows
4. **Security-First:** Security testing integrated at every layer, not afterthought
5. **Performance-Aware:** Performance validation embedded in all test levels
6. **Mobile-First:** Testing strategy optimized for mobile platforms and constraints

### Quality Philosophy
- **Quality is feature work:** Testing tasks are implementation requirements, not optional activities
- **Tests mirror usage:** Test scenarios reflect real user behavior and edge cases
- **Flakiness is critical debt:** Unstable tests are technical debt requiring immediate attention
- **ATDD Implementation:** Acceptance Test Driven Development - tests written first, implementation follows
