# Package Architecture Requirements

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish clear modular boundaries for maintainable scaling
- Enable parallel development across feature teams
- Ensure loose coupling and high cohesion between modules
- Support independent testing and deployment readiness
- Provide clear guidance for package dependency management

### Background Context
The Craft Video Marketplace requires a modular package architecture to support complex feature interactions while maintaining development velocity. This document defines the complete package separation requirements for both Flutter client and Serverpod backend, ensuring alignment with the modular monolith strategy defined in the main architecture document.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Package Structure Requirements
- **PSR1**: Flutter client SHALL organize features as separate packages under `packages/features/`
- **PSR2**: Each feature package SHALL contain `use_cases/` and `presentation/` layers only. Data layer operations SHALL be centralized in the core package.
- **PSR3**: Serverpod backend SHALL organize modules as separate packages under `serverpod/packages/modules/`
- **PSR4**: Shared domain models SHALL reside in `packages/shared_models/` for client-server consistency
- **PSR5**: Core utilities and design system SHALL be isolated in `packages/core/` and `packages/design_system/`

#### Package Interface Requirements
- **PSR6**: Each package SHALL expose a single public API file (`lib/<package_name>.dart`)
- **PSR7**: Package interfaces SHALL define clear input/output contracts for all public methods
- **PSR8**: Internal implementation details SHALL be hidden through proper library privacy
- **PSR9**: Cross-package communication SHALL occur through well-defined interfaces only
- **PSR10**: Package breaking changes SHALL follow semantic versioning principles

#### Dependency Management Requirements
- **PSR11**: Package dependencies SHALL follow directed acyclic graph (DAG) principles
- **PSR12**: Feature packages MAY depend on core and shared packages only
- **PSR13**: Core packages SHALL NOT depend on feature packages (circular dependency prevention)
- **PSR14**: All dependencies SHALL be explicitly declared in package `pubspec.yaml` files
- **PSR15**: Development dependencies SHALL be separated from production dependencies

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Maintainability Requirements
- **NFR1**: Each package SHALL be independently understandable without knowledge of other packages
- **NFR2**: Package size SHALL not exceed 10,000 lines of code without architectural review
- **NFR3**: Package public API SHALL maintain backward compatibility within major versions
- **NFR4**: Package documentation SHALL cover all public interfaces with examples
- **NFR5**: Package changes SHALL not require recompilation of unrelated packages

#### Testing Requirements
- **NFR6**: Each package SHALL have comprehensive unit tests covering all public APIs
- **NFR7**: Package integration tests SHALL validate cross-package interactions
- **NFR8**: Mock implementations SHALL be provided for all external dependencies
- **NFR9**: Test coverage SHALL not fall below 80% for any package
- **NFR10**: Package tests SHALL run independently without external setup requirements

#### Performance Requirements
- **NFR11**: Package import time SHALL not exceed 100ms for any single package
- **NFR12**: Package bundle size impact SHALL be tracked and optimized
- **NFR13**: Cross-package communication overhead SHALL not exceed 10ms per call
- **NFR14**: Package initialization SHALL be lazy where possible to improve startup time
- **NFR15**: Memory usage SHALL be monitored per package to prevent leaks

```

## Package Interface Contracts

### Standard Package API Template
Each package SHALL expose its functionality through a single public API file with the following structure:

```dart
// lib/package_name.dart
// Export feature-specific use cases
export 'use_cases/auth_usecase.dart';
export 'use_cases/login_usecase.dart';

// Export main UI components
export 'presentation/bloc/auth_bloc.dart';
export 'presentation/pages/auth_page.dart';
export 'presentation/widgets/auth_form.dart';

// Export any public utilities
export 'utils/package_utils.dart';
```

### Cross-Package Communication Patterns

#### Event-Driven Communication
- **Pattern**: Packages communicate through typed events
- **Implementation**: Use `package:event_bus` or similar
- **Contract**: Event definitions shared in `shared_models`

#### Repository Pattern
- **Pattern**: Core package contains all data layer operations
- **Implementation**: Feature packages use use cases to coordinate with core repositories
- **Contract**: Repository interfaces defined in core package

#### Service Locator Pattern
- **Pattern**: Dependency injection through service locator
- **Implementation**: Use `get_it` or similar DI framework
- **Contract**: Services registered at app initialization

## Dependency Governance Rules

### Allowed Dependency Directions
```
Feature Packages → Core Packages ✓
Feature Packages → Shared Models ✓
Feature Packages → Design System ✓
Core Packages → Feature Packages ✗
Shared Models → Feature Packages ✗
Design System → Feature Packages ✗
```

### Dependency Management Guidelines

#### Adding New Dependencies
1. **Check if dependency already exists** in core packages
2. **Evaluate impact** on package size and performance
3. **Consider alternative** implementations
4. **Document rationale** in package README
5. **Update documentation** and examples

#### Version Management
1. **Pin major versions** for shared dependencies
2. **Use compatible ranges** for minor versions
3. **Test compatibility** across all dependent packages
4. **Document upgrade procedures** with breaking changes

## Development Workflow

### Multi-Package Development Process

#### Local Development
1. **Use Flutter workspaces** or Melos for package management
2. **Link packages** via path dependencies for development
3. **Run tests** across all packages with single command
4. **Hot reload** should work across package boundaries

#### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit tests** within each package
2. **Integration tests** for package interactions
3. **End-to-end tests** for complete user flows
4. **Performance tests** for package boundaries

#### Build and Release
1. **Independent package builds** for parallel development
2. **Dependency verification** before release
3. **Automated testing** across all packages
4. **Version tagging** with semantic versioning

### Tooling Configuration

#### Melos Configuration (melos.yaml)
```yaml
name: video_window
packages:
  - packages/*
  - packages/features/*

scripts:
  analyze: melos exec -- flutter analyze
  test: melos exec -- flutter test
  build: melos exec -- flutter build apk
  format: melos exec -- dart format .

environments:
  sdk: '>=3.8.0 <4.0.0'
  flutter: '>=3.35.0'
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Parallel package analysis** and testing
2. **Dependency vulnerability scanning**
3. **Package size monitoring**
4. **Cross-package integration testing**

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create package directory structure
- Set up Melos/Flutter workspace
- Migrate existing code to core packages
- Establish shared models

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction
- Extract one feature at a time to packages
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Update imports and dependencies
- Test package isolation

### Phase 3: Integration and Optimization
- Optimize package dependencies
- Implement cross-package communication patterns
- Add comprehensive package tests
- Document package APIs

## Quality Gates

### Package Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Single public API file exists
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Unit test coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Package size < 10,000 LOC
- [ ] Public API documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Integration tests pass

### Automated Validation
1. **Dependency graph analysis** to prevent cycles
2. **Package size monitoring** with alerts
3. **Test coverage enforcement** via CI
4. **Performance regression testing**
5. **Security vulnerability scanning**

## Conclusion

These package architecture requirements provide the foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and well-structured Flutter + Serverpod application. Following these guidelines will ensure that the Craft Video Marketplace can grow in complexity while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.

Regular reviews of these requirements should occur as the application evolves and new patterns emerge in the Flutter ecosystem.
