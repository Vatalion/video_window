# ADR-0002: Flutter + Serverpod Architecture

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Accepted
**Decider(s):** Technical Lead, Architecture Team
**Reviewers:** Development Team, QA Team

## Context
The platform requires a cross-platform mobile application with a robust backend for video processing, real-time auctions, and payment processing. We need to choose a technology stack that provides excellent developer experience, performance, and maintainability while supporting our auction-focused requirements.

## Decision
Adopt Flutter 3.19.6 for the frontend and Serverpod 2.9.x for the backend, creating a unified Dart-based technology stack with type-safe communication between client and server.

## Options Considered

1. **Option A** - React Native + Node.js/Express
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, JavaScript ubiquity, extensive libraries
   - Cons: Performance overhead, separate language stacks, type safety challenges
   - Risk: Performance limitations for real-time video features

2. **Option B** - Native iOS/Android + Custom Backend
   - Pros: Best performance, platform-specific optimizations
   - Cons: Separate codebases, higher development cost, complex maintenance
   - Risk: Resource intensive for team size

3. **Option C** - Flutter + Node.js/Firebase
   - Pros: Cross-platform frontend, established backend
   - Cons: Different languages, integration complexity, vendor lock-in
   - Risk: Type safety and maintenance overhead

4. **Option D** - Flutter + Serverpod (Chosen)
   - Pros: Single language stack, type-safe RPC, built-in features, excellent Dart integration
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem than Node.js, learning curve for Serverpod
   - Risk: Serverpod maturity for complex requirements

## Decision Outcome
Chose Option D: Flutter + Serverpod. This provides:
- Unified Dart language stack
- Type-safe client-server communication
- Built-in authentication, database, and file storage
- Excellent performance for real-time features
- Strong developer experience

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Type-safe API communication
  - Shared models between client and server
  - Single language expertise needed
  - Excellent performance characteristics
  - Built-in real-time WebSocket support
  - Integrated development workflow

- **Negative:**
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js
  - Serverpod learning curve
  - Fewer third-party packages
  - Potential limitations in advanced database queries

- **Neutral:**
  - Dart/Flutter developer availability
  - Build and deployment complexity
  - Testing and debugging requirements
