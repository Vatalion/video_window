# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records for the Video Window marketplace platform. ADRs capture important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## ADR Process

### Overview
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a formal mechanism for documenting architectural decisions in this project. They provide a historical record of decisions made, the reasoning behind them, and their consequences.

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR for any decision that:
- Affects the system's structure or behavior
- Impacts multiple components or teams
- Changes how data flows through the system
- Alters the technology stack or major dependencies
- Affects security, performance, or scalability
- Will be difficult or expensive to reverse

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial proposal created
2. **Review**: Team review and feedback
3. **Accepted**: Decision implemented
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision
5. **Deprecated**: No longer relevant

### ADR Template

Use the following template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Draft|Proposed|Accepted|Rejected|Superseded|Deprecated]
**Decider(s):** [Name(s)]
**Reviewers:** [Name(s)]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Options Considered
1. **Option A** - [Brief description]
   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...
2. **Option B** - [Brief description]
   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

## Decision Outcome
[Chosen option and why]

## Consequences
- **Positive:** ...
- **Negative:** ...
- **Neutral:** ...

## Implementation
[How will this decision be implemented?]

## Related ADRs
- [List of related ADR numbers]

## References
[Links to relevant documentation, discussions, etc.]
```

### ADR Workflow

1. **Creation**
   - Create a new ADR file using the next available number
   - Use the template above
   - Set status to "Draft"

2. **Review Process**
   - Share with the technical team
   - Request feedback from relevant stakeholders
   - Address concerns and incorporate feedback

3. **Approval**
   - Update status to "Accepted"
   - Add implementation details
   - Share with team for visibility

4. **Implementation**
   - Implement the decision
   - Update ADR with implementation details
   - Link to related code/documentation

5. **Maintenance**
   - Update ADR if implementation differs from plan
   - Create new ADR if decision is superseded
   - Mark deprecated ADRs appropriately

### ADR Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially:
- ADR-0001: Reserved for project direction pivot
- ADR-0002 to ADR-0099: Core architectural decisions
- ADR-0100 to ADR-0199: Security and compliance decisions
- ADR-0200 to ADR-0299: Performance and scalability decisions
- ADR-0300 to ADR-0399: Integration and API decisions
- ADR-0400+: Future architectural decisions

### Review and Approval Process

#### Review Criteria
1. **Technical Soundness**: Is the solution technically viable?
2. **Alignment**: Does it align with project goals and constraints?
3. **Trade-offs**: Are trade-offs clearly articulated?
4. **Consequences**: Are consequences understood and acceptable?
5. **Implementation**: Is the implementation plan realistic?

#### Approval Process
1. **Technical Review**: Reviewed by technical leads
2. **Business Review**: Reviewed by product owner when applicable
3. **Final Approval**: Approved by architectural decision committee
4. **Documentation**: Published and communicated to team

#### Review Frequency
- **Draft ADRs**: Reviewed within 1 week of creation
- **Implementation Review**: Reviewed during implementation phase
- **Periodic Review**: All accepted ADRs reviewed quarterly for relevance

### ADR Tools and Automation

- **Templates**: Standardized templates for consistency
- **Index Generation**: Automated index generation from ADR files
- **Cross-references**: Automatic linking between related ADRs
- **Status Tracking**: Automated status tracking and notifications
- **Integration**: Integration with GitHub for version control and review

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete details and examples
2. **Document Trade-offs**: Clearly articulate pros and cons
3. **Include Context**: Provide sufficient background information
4. **Think Long-term**: Consider future implications
5. **Keep Updated**: Maintain ADRs as implementation evolves
6. **Cross-reference**: Link to related ADRs and documentation
7. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid jargon and be accessible
8. **Seek Feedback**: Involve relevant stakeholders early

### ADR Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly review of all active ADRs
- **Status Updates**: Update status as projects evolve
- **Supersession**: Create new ADRs when decisions change
- **Deprecation**: Mark obsolete ADRs appropriately
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation current with implementation
