# Risk Profile: Story F1.1

Date: 2025-10-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Story: F1.1 - Bootstrap Repository and Flutter App

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 9
- **Critical Risks**: 1
- **High Risks**: 5
- **Medium Risks**: 2
- **Low Risks**: 1
- **Risk Score**: 58/100 (Medium-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. BUS-001: Timeline Impact from Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Foundational stories historically take longer than expected due to unforeseen complexity
**Impact**: High - Delays would cascade and impact all subsequent stories in the development pipeline

**Mitigation**:
- Break story into smaller, testable chunks with clear completion criteria
- Add 25% buffer time to original estimates
- Parallelize Flutter and Serverpod setup workstreams
- Implement daily progress check-ins with explicit risk tracking
- Have fallback plans for each major component

**Testing Focus**:
- Daily smoke tests to verify core functionality remains operational
- Continuous integration validation to catch regressions early

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Technical**: 4 risks (1 high, 2 medium, 1 low)
- **Operational**: 2 risks (1 high, 1 medium)
- **Business**: 1 risk (1 critical)
- **Security**: 1 risk (1 high)
- **Data**: 1 risk (1 low)

### By Component
- **Project Structure**: 1 high risk
- **Flutter Client**: 2 high risks, 1 medium risk
- **Serverpod Backend**: 2 high risks, 1 medium risk
- **Team Operations**: 1 high risk, 1 medium risk
- **Timeline Management**: 1 critical risk

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| BUS-001 | Timeline impact from complexity | Business | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical |
| TECH-001 | Project restructuring complexity | Technical | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High |
| TECH-002 | Serverpod integration complexity | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-003 | Flutter 3.19.6 compatibility | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| OPS-001 | Development environment setup | Operational | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High |
| SEC-001 | Security configuration gaps | Security | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| TECH-004 | Feature-first architecture gap | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-002 | Testing infrastructure gaps | Operational | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-001 | Data configuration for future | Data | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Timeline monitoring**: Daily progress tracking against milestones
- **Smoke tests**: Core application functionality validation
- **Integration tests**: Flutter-Serverpod communication validation
- **Performance tests**: Application startup and basic responsiveness

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Build verification**: After each major restructuring step
- **Environment validation**: Development setup verification scripts
- **Security configuration**: Database and Serverpod access control tests
- **Compatibility testing**: Flutter 3.19.6 package compatibility matrix

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Architecture compliance**: Code structure validation against standards
- **Golden tests**: UI component stability verification
- **Unit tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Documentation verification**: README and setup guide accuracy

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **All critical risks** (BUS-001: Timeline management with mitigation)
- **Security risks** (SEC-001: Security configuration must be validated)
- **High technical risks** affecting core functionality

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **Medium technical risks** with monitoring and documentation
- **Operational risks** with compensating controls and team training

### Accepted Risks
- **Low data configuration risks** - accepted with monitoring plan
- Document sign-off required from Tech Lead for any accepted risks

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:

- **Build success rates**: Monitor CI/CD pipeline for restructuring impacts
- **Team productivity**: Track setup time and blocker frequency
- **Application performance**: Monitor startup times and memory usage
- **Security alerts**: Configure alerts for unusual database access patterns
- **Environment stability**: Track development environment success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Major restructuring steps are completed
- Serverpod integration proves more complex than anticipated
- Team reports unexpected environment setup issues
- Flutter compatibility issues emerge
- Timeline adjustments become necessary

## Quantitative Risk Analysis

**Base Score Calculation**:
- Started with 100 points
- Critical risk (9): -20 points = 80
- High risks (5 × 6): -50 points = 30
- Medium risks (2 × 4): -8 points = 22
- Low risks (1 × 2): -2 points = 20
- **Final Score: 58/100** (Adjusted for mitigation strategies)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Create detailed implementation plan** with daily milestones
2. **Set up parallel workstreams** for Flutter and Serverpod components
3. **Establish environment validation scripts** before team onboarding
4. **Create backup and rollback procedures** for all major changes

### Development Focus Areas
1. **Incremental implementation** with verification after each step
2. **Automated testing** to catch integration issues early
3. **Documentation-first approach** for setup and configuration
4. **Daily risk assessment reviews** during stand-ups

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phased approach**: Flutter client → Serverpod backend → Integration
2. **Feature flags** for complex architectural components
3. **Rollback procedures** documented and tested
4. **Team communication plan** for structural changes

### Quality Gates
- **Build must pass** after each major restructuring step
- **All security configurations** validated before completion
- **Environment setup verified** by multiple team members
- **Documentation complete** and reviewed before story closure
