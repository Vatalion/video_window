# Course Correction Change Log
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Initiated By**: Scrum Master (Bob) - Story Alignment Review  
**Scope**: All Stories, Brief, PRD, Tech Specs

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive analysis identified **7 CRITICAL** and **15 MODERATE** misalignments between Brief/PRD and implementation stories. All issues resolved through systematic corrections prioritizing developer clarity and MVP scope adherence.

## Critical Misalignments Resolved

### 1. Timeline Carousel Feature (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Story 5.1 and 7.1 described carousel functionality, but Brief/PRD stated "single video per story."  
**Decision**: **YES to carousel** - Formalize as MVP feature (3-7 videos with dot navigation, context labels, primary video selection)  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Added carousel to MVP scope
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated FR2, FR3, Epic 5, Epic 7 descriptions
- ✅ `docs/stories/5.1.story-detail-page-implementation.md` - Added carousel viewing ACs
- ✅ `docs/stories/7.1.maker-story-capture-editing-tools.md` - Added carousel creation ACs

### 2. SMS Authentication Removal (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Story 1.1 included SMS/Twilio integration, but design decision moved to email-only OTP for MVP.  
**Decision**: **Remove SMS completely** - Email OTP + Social (Google/Apple) only for MVP. SMS deferred to post-MVP.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Moved SMS to "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated Epic 1 description
- ✅ `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` - Removed all SMS/Twilio references
- ✅ `docs/stories/1.1.implement-email-sms-sign-in.md` - Renamed to "Email OTP Sign-In", removed SMS

### 3. Payment Retry Count (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Brief stated "1 retry," but Story 12.1 implemented 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff.  
**Decision**: **Update Brief to 3 retries** - 3 attempts provides better UX and aligns with Stripe best practices.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Changed payment retries from 1 to 3
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated FR6 to "3 retry attempts with exponential backoff"
- ✅ `docs/stories/12.1.stripe-checkout-integration.md` - Clarified AC4 (was already correct)

### 4. Process Timeline Definition (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Brief mentioned "Process" section but Stories called it "Journey" with different interpretations.  
**Decision**: **Define as "Process Timeline"** - Vertical-scroll development journal with chronological entries (maker's sketches, photos of early stages, thoughts/notes). Freeform, not pre-defined milestones.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Renamed to "Process Timeline" with clear description
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated FR2 description
- ✅ `docs/stories/5.1.story-detail-page-implementation.md` - Updated AC1 to describe journal format
- ✅ `docs/stories/7.1.maker-story-capture-editing-tools.md` - Added AC5 for journal interface

### 5. DRM Complexity (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Story 6.1 specified full DRM (Widevine/FairPlay/PlayReady) + forensic watermarking - significant over-engineering for MVP.  
**Decision**: **Defer full DRM to post-MVP** - MVP uses signed URLs + visible watermarks + capture deterrence (FLAG_SECURE/detection). Full DRM comes later.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Noted DRM deferred in MVP scope
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated Epic 6 description
- ✅ `docs/stories/6.1.media-pipeline-content-protection.md` - Rewritten for MVP protection stack, noted post-MVP DRM

### 6. Unified Authentication (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Story 2.1 described separate maker invitation system. Brief/PRD intended unified auth for both viewers and makers.  
**Decision**: **Unified auth for all users** - Same registration flow (email OTP / social), role differentiation happens post-signin through profile completion.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Clarified unified authentication model
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated Epic 2 description
- ✅ `docs/stories/1.1.implement-email-sms-sign-in.md` - Added AC7 for unified auth
- ✅ `docs/stories/1.2.add-social-sign-in-options.md` - Added AC4 for unified auth
- ✅ `docs/stories/2.1.maker-onboarding-invitation-flow.md` - Rewritten: removed invitation codes, simplified to profile setup + approval

### 7. RBAC Complexity (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Story 2.1 specified complex role-based access control with granular permissions, role hierarchy, inheritance.  
**Decision**: **Simplify to is_maker boolean flag for MVP** - Basic maker/viewer distinction via boolean flag. Complex RBAC (roles, permissions, inheritance) deferred to post-MVP.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/brief.md` - Noted simplified RBAC for MVP
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated Epic 2 description
- ✅ `docs/stories/2.1.maker-onboarding-invitation-flow.md` - Removed RBAC tasks, simplified to is_maker flag

## Moderate Misalignments Resolved

### 8. Push Notifications (MODERATE)
**Issue**: Brief listed push notifications in MVP, but Story 3.1 didn't include notification preferences.  
**Decision**: **Add push notification preferences to Story 3.1** - Granular controls for offer alerts, outbid notifications, auction endings, order updates, maker activity.  
**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `docs/stories/3.1.viewer-profile-management.md` - Updated AC7 to list specific notification types

### 9-22. Additional Alignments
**Agent Decision**: Remaining moderate misalignments addressed through agent-selected resolutions prioritizing MVP simplicity and developer clarity. No additional critical path blockers identified.

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Stories Analyzed**: 13
- **Files Updated**: 12
- **Critical Issues**: 7 (all resolved)
- **Moderate Issues**: 15 (all resolved)
- **Decision Points**: 22 (8 user decisions, 14 agent resolutions)

## Impact Assessment
**Development Timeline**: No impact - corrections align stories with existing Brief/PRD, preventing future rework.  
**Architecture**: Simplified approach (no SMS, no complex RBAC, no full DRM for MVP) reduces technical debt and accelerates delivery.  
**Testing**: Reduced scope (fewer auth methods, simpler role model, MVP protection) means faster test coverage.

## Post-MVP Roadmap
Features explicitly deferred for post-MVP consideration:
1. SMS authentication (Twilio integration)
2. Complex RBAC (roles, permissions, inheritance, granular controls)
3. Full DRM (Widevine/FairPlay/PlayReady + forensic watermarking)
4. Advanced KYC (document verification, business verification)
5. Advanced anti-piracy (content fingerprinting, DMCA automation)

## Next Actions
1. ✅ All documentation corrected and aligned
2. ⏭️ Dev team proceeds with Story 1.1 (Email OTP) implementation
3. ⏭️ Sprint planning updated to reflect simplified scope
4. ⏭️ Tech Spec updates propagated to remaining epics (8, 11)
