# Archive Directory

**Purpose:** Historical documentation artifacts that have been superseded by current documentation

## Archived Files

### Documentation Audit Artifacts
- **final-documentation-audit-summary.md** - Superseded by validation-status-consolidation.md and missing-stories-analysis.md
- **TECH-SPEC-AUDIT-REPORT.md** - Outdated status, current status tracked in epic-validation-backlog.md
- **course-correction-change-log.md** - Historical changes already incorporated into current documentation

## Archive Policy

Files are archived (not deleted) when:
1. They provide outdated status information
2. They have been superseded by newer, more accurate documentation
3. They could mislead stakeholders about current project state
4. They are no longer referenced by active development processes

Archived files are retained for historical reference but should not be used for current development decisions.
