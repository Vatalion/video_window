# Experimentation Backlog & Operating Guide

## Purpose
Provide a shared reference for designing, prioritizing, and recording experiments tied to the PRD’s Experimentation & Optimization backlog.

## Workflow
1. **Brief:** Product/Growth drafts hypothesis, metric target, and test design.
2. **Review:** PM + Data + Engineering assess feasibility, guardrails, and instrumentation coverage.
3. **Launch:** Record experiment ID, variant rollout plan, and monitoring dashboards here.
4. **Analyze:** Post-test, document outcome summary and decision. If learning-worthy, add detailed write-up under `summaries/`.
5. **Archive:** Move completed experiments to historical log with final decision (Ship, Iterate, Drop).

## Experiment Log (MVP)
| ID | Name | Hypothesis | Status | Owner | Start | End | Decision |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|-----|----------|
| EXP-001 | Process Badge Conversion Test | Highlighting process badges increases object checkout initiation by 10%. | Planned | PM + Design | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| EXP-002 | Concierge Outreach vs Automated Prompt | Targeted outreach recovers creator uploads 2× faster than automated prompts. | Planned | Ops | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| EXP-003 | Waitlist Referral Incentive | $15 referral credit yields 20% lift in referral-driven purchases. | Planned | Growth | TBD | TBD | TBD |
