# Buying Guide - Smart Bidding & Purchasing

## Overview

This guide explains how to navigate our unique offer-to-auction system, make smart purchasing decisions, and ensure a smooth buying experience from discovery to delivery.

1. **Discovery Phase** - Browse video stories in your feed
2. **Offer Phase** - First qualified offer triggers the auction
3. **Auction Phase** - 72-hour competitive bidding period
4. **Decision Phase** - Maker can accept high bid anytime
5. **Payment Phase** - 24-hour window to complete purchase

### Key Benefits
