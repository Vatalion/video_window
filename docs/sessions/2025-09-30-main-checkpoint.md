# Main Agent Checkpoint — 2025-09-30

Status: In Progress — documentation staging complete; story drafting pending.

## Summary
- Architecture and PRD aligned (see `docs/prd.md` v0.2, `docs/architecture.md` v0.2, ADR-0002).
- Front-end architecture outline established with TODOs for design tokens and media pipeline.
- UX handoff updated with hi-fi deliverable deadline (2025-10-07); wireframe inventory indexed.
- QA/PO/Architect reviews done; primary remaining gap is absence of story drafts under `docs/stories/`.

## Work Completed
- PO change log and Next Steps updated.
- Architecture change log and ADR added; lead review notes track open actions.
- UX wireframe README created for asset tracking.
- QA noted story file gap; Scrum Master standing by for story drafting.

## Next Actions
1. Draft story files for Epic F1 (and subsequent epics) in `docs/stories/` following naming convention `story/<id>-<slug>.md`.
2. Run SM story checklist and QA reviews once drafts exist.
3. UX to deliver hi-fi mockups by 2025-10-07 and update wireframe README.
4. Resolve notification procurement ticket (#PROC-582) before Epic 11 work.

## Notes
- Architectural documentation is considered ready for development once story drafts exist and are validated.
- Main Agent to orchestrate story creation next session.
