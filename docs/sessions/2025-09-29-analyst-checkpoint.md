Status: Follow-up — PRD epic roadmap expanded for PM handoff.

## Status Alignment
- PRD drafting remains in progress; the epic roadmap now matches the brief’s scope and platform guardrails.

## Next Suggested Actions
- Break down Epic F1 stories for PM execution handoff.
- Confirm remaining PRD sections that still need content before QA and architect personas engage.
